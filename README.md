# English Philosophical Texts Online

*English Philosophical Texts Online* is a project at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk), the aim of which is to collect together the best digital editions of a broad canon of works from Hobbes to Mill, to make them freely available in one place, and to provide intuitive software for performing sophisticated searches and stylometric analyses of these texts.

This is an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) app. The skeleton was build with the [Express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html). The directory structure follows the generator's defaults, so anyone familiar with that should find little to surprise them here.

Code follows the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).
