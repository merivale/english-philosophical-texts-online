The worst of Magistracys, <em>the mere Despotick kind,</em> can shew sufficient Instances of Zeal and Affection towards it. Where no other Government is known, it seldom fails of having that Allegiance and Duty paid it, which is owing to a better Form. The Eastern Countrys, and many barbarous Nations, have been and still are Examples of this kind. The personal Love they bear their Prince, however severe towards them, may shew, how natural an Affection there is towards Government and Order among Mankind. If Men have <em>really</em> no publick Parent, no Magistrate in common to cherish and protect 'em, they will still <em>imagine</em> they have such a one; and, like new-born Creatures who have never seen their Dam, will fansy one for themselves, and apply (as by Nature prompted) to some like Form, for Favour and Protection. In the room of a <em>true Foster-Father,</em> and <em>Chief,</em> they will take after <em>a false one;</em> and in the room of a <em>legal Government</em> and <em>just Prince,</em> obey even <em>a Tyrant,</em> and endure a whole Lineage and Succession of such.</p>"

Thus <em>Faith, Justice, Honesty,</em> and <em>Virtue,</em> must have been as early as the State of Nature, or they cou'd never have been <em>at all.</em> The Civil Union, or Confederacy, cou'd never make <em>Right</em> or <em>Wrong;</em> if they subsisted not before. He who was free to any Villany before his Contract, will, and ought to make as free with his Contract, when he thinks fit. The <em>Natural Knave</em> has the same reason to be <em>a Civil one;</em> and may dispense with his politick Capacity as oft as he sees occasion: 'Tis only <em>his Word</em> stands in his way.—A Man is oblig'd <em>to keep his Word.</em> Why? Because <em>he has given his</em> <em>Word to keep it.</em>—Is not this a notable Account of the Original of moral Justice, and the Rise of Civil Government and Allegiance!</p>"

      "content": "<p><em>Viz.</em> The two <em>Casaubons, Is.</em> and <em>Mer. Salmasius,</em> and our <em>English Gataker:</em> See the first in <em>Capitolinus, Vit. M. Ant. sub finem.</em> The second in his Comment on <em>M. Ant.</em> lib. 1. sect. 13, &amp; 16. <em>Gataker</em> on the same place; and <em>Salmasius</em> in the same Life of <em>Capitolinus,</em> at the end of his Annotations. The <em>Greek</em> word is Κοινονοημοσύνη [common sensibility], which <em>Salmasius</em> interprets, <q>moderatam, usitatam &amp; ordinariam hominis mentem quae in commune quodammodo consulit, nec omnia ad commodum suum refert, respectumque etiam habet eorum cum quibus versatur, modestè, modicéque de se sentiens. At contra inflati &amp; superbi omnes se sibi tantùm suisque commodis natos arbitrantur, &amp; prae se caeteros contemnunt &amp; negligunt; &amp; hi sunt qui <em>Sensum Communem</em> non habere rectè dici possunt. Nam ita <em>Sensum Communem</em> accipit <em>Juvenalis,</em> Sat. 8. <em>Rarus enim fermè</em> SENSUS COMMUNIS, <em>&amp;c.</em> φιλανθρωπίαν &amp; χρηστότητα <em>Galenus</em> vocat, quam Marcus de se loquens κοινονοημοσύνην; &amp; alibi, ubi de eadem re loquitur, Μετριότητα καὶ Εὐγνωμοσύνην, qua gratiam illi fecerit Marcus simul eundi ad Germanicum Bellum ac sequendi se.</q> [the moderate, customary and ordinary disposition of a man who in some measure has regard for the common good and does not refer all things to his personal advantage and also has consideration for those with whom he is engaged, temperately and modestly confident of himself. But on the other hand all those men, swollen and proud, think that they have been born only for themselves and for their own interests and they little value all other men in comparison with themselves and are indifferent to them. And these are such men who can be said rightly not to have common sense. For so Juvenal Sat. viii understood <em>sensum communem,</em> For quite rare is common sense, etc. Galen calls it Philanthropy and Kindness whereas Marcus coins it common sensibility, and in another place where he employs similar terms for measuredness and kindness in accord with which Marcus did the favor for the man of going to the German war and at the same time of attending him.] In the same manner <em>Isaac Casaubon: Herodianus,</em> says he, calls this the τὸ μέτριον καὶ ἰσόμετρον. <q>Subjicit verò <em>Antoninus</em> quasi hanc vocem interpretans, καὶ τὸ ἐφει̑σθαι τοὶς φίλοις μήτε συνδειπνει̑ν αὐτῳ̑ πάντως, μήτε συναποδημει̑ν ἐπάναγκες.</q> [Herodian calls this the mean and equal. Antoninus suggests, as if interpreting this thought, it is necessary that he never permit his friends either to dine with him or to go abroad with him.] This, I am persuaded, is the <em>Sensus Communis</em> of <b>Horace,</b> Sat. 3. lib. 1. which has been unobserv'd, as far as I can learn, by any of his Commentators: it being remarkable withal, that in this early Satir of <b>Horace,</b> before his latter days, and when his Philosophy as yet inclin'd to the less rigid Assertors of Virtue, he puts this Expression (as may be seen by the whole Satir taken together) into the Mouth of a <em>Crispinus,</em> or some ridiculous Mimick of that severe Philosophy, to which the Coinage of the word κοινονοημοσύνη [common sensibility] properly belong'd. For so the Poet again (<em>Sat.</em> 4. <em>v.</em> 77.) uses the word SENSUS, speaking of those who without <em>Sense</em> of Manners, or common Society, without the least respect or deference to others, press rudely upon their Friends, and upon all Company in general, without regard to Time or Place, or any thing besides their selfish and brutish Humour:</p><p>—<em>Haud illud quaerentes, num sine SENSU,</em> <br><em>Tempore num faciant alieno.</em>——ἀναισθητω̑ς,</p><p>[They do something without asking whether it is senseless or at an inconvenient time——imperceptibly]</p><p>as old <em>Lambin</em> interprets it, tho without any other Explanation; referring only to the <em>Sensus Communis</em> of <b>Horace</b> in that other Satir. Thus <b>Seneca,</b> Epist. 105. <em>Odium autem ex offensa sic vitabis, neminem lacessendo gratuitò: à quo te SENSUS COMMUNIS tuebitur.</em> [Moreover, you will avoid hatred from offenses by provoking no one unnecessarily: from which common sense will protect you.] And <b>Cicero</b> accordingly, <em>Justitiae partes sunt, non violare homines: Verecundiae, non offendere.</em> Lib. 1. de Off. [The function of justice is not to harm men, that of respect not to offend them.] It may be objected possibly by some, particularly vers'd in the Philosophy above-mention'd, that the κοίνος νοὺς [common understanding], to which the Κοινονοημοσύνη [common sensibility] seems to have relation, is of a different meaning. But they will consider withal how small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the ὑπόληψις [conjecture], and the vulgar αἴσθησις [perception]; how generally <em>Passion</em> was by those Philosophers brought under the Head of <em>Opinion.</em> And when they consider, besides this, the very Formation of the word Κοινονοημοσύνη [common sensibility] upon the Model of the other femaliz'd Virtues, the Εὐγνωμοσύνη, Σωφροσύνη, Δικαιοσύνη, [kindness, moderation, justice,] <em>&amp;c.</em> they will no longer hesitate on this Interpretation.—The Reader may perhaps by this Note see better why the <em>Latin</em> Title of <em>Sensus Communis</em> has been given to this second Treatise. He may observe, withal, how the same Poet <b>Juvenal</b> uses the word <em>Sensus,</em> in Sat. 15. <em>Haec nostri pars optima Sensûs.</em> [This quality of gentleness is the best part of our sense.]</p>"
