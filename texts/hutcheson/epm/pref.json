But beside that general Consideration, that old Arguments may sometimes be set in such a Light by one, as will convince those who were not moved by them, even when better expressed by another; since, for every Class of <em>Writers</em>, there are Classes of <em>Readers</em> adapted, who cannot relish any thing higher: Besides this, I say, the very <em>Novelty</em> of a Book may procure a little Attention, from those who over‐look the Writings which the World has long enjoyed. And if by <em>Curiosity</em>, or any other means, some few can be engaged to turn their Thoughts to these important Subjects, about which a little <em>Reflection</em> will discover the Truth, and a thorough <em>Consideration</em> of it may occasion a great Increase of real Happiness; no Person need be ashamed of his Labours as useless, which do such Service to any of his Fellow‐Creatures.</p>"

And farther, that to discover Truth on these Subjects, nothing more is necessary than a little <em>Attention to what passes in our own Hearts</em>, and consequently every Man may come to Certainty in these Points, without much Art or Knowledge of other Matters.</p>"

Many are really <em>virtuous</em> who cannot explain what <em>Virtue</em> is. Some act a most generous disinterested Part in Life, who have been taught to account for all their Actions by <em>Self‐Love</em>, as their sole Spring. There have been very different and opposite Opinions in <em>Opticks</em>, contrary Accounts have been given of <em>Hearing</em>, <em>voluntary Motion</em>, <em>Digestion</em>, and other <em>natural Actions</em>. But the Powers themselves in reality perform their several Operations with sufficient Constancy and Uniformity, in Persons of good Health, whatever their Opinions be about them. In the same manner our <em>moral Actions</em> and <em>Affections</em> may be in good order, when our Opinions are quite wrong about them. <em>True Opinions</em> however, about both, may enable us to <em>improve</em> our natural Powers, and to <em>rectify</em> accidental Disorders incident unto them.

But let it be remembered here, that though there can be no <em>Motives</em> or <em>Arguments</em> suggested which can directly raise any <em>ultimate Desire</em>, such as that of our <em>own Happiness</em>, or <em>publick Affections</em> (as we attempt to prove in <cite><em>Treatise</em> IV</cite>;) yet if both are <em>natural Dispositions</em> of our Minds, and nothing can stop the Operation of <em>publick Affections</em> but some <em>selfish Interest</em>, the only way to give publick Affections their full Force, and to make them prevalent in our Lives, must be to remove these <em>Opinions of opposite Interests</em>, and to shew a superior Interest on their side.

We have got the Number <em>Five</em> fixed for our <em>external Senses</em>, though a larger Number might as easily be defended. We have Multitudes of Perceptions which have no relation to any <em>external Sensation</em>; if by it we mean <em>Perceptions immediately occasioned by Motions or Impressions made on our Bodies</em>, such as the Ideas of <em>Number</em>, <em>Duration</em>, <em>Proportion</em>, <em>Virtue</em>, <em>Vice</em>, <em>Pleasures of Honour</em>, <em>of Congratulation</em>; <em>the Pains of Remorse</em>, <em>Shame</em>, <em>Sympathy</em>, and many others.

Had they in like manner considered our <em>Affections</em> without a previous Notion, that they were all from <em>Self‐Love</em>, they might have felt an <em>ultimate Desire</em> of the Happiness of others as easily conceivable, and as certainly implanted in the human Breast, though perhaps not so strong as <em>Self‐Love</em>.</p>"

One may easily see from the great <em>variety of Terms</em>, and diversity of <em>Schemes</em> invented, that all Men <em>feel</em> something in their own Hearts recommending Virtue, which yet it is difficult to explain. This Difficulty probably arises from our previous Notions of a small Number of <em>Senses</em>, so that we are unwilling to have recourse in our Theories to any more; and rather strain out some Explication of moral Ideas, with relation to some other natural Powers of Perception universally acknowledged. The like difficulty attends several other <em>Perceptions</em>, to the Reception of which Philosophers have not generally assigned their <em>distinct Senses</em>; such as <em>natural Beauty</em>, <em>Harmony</em>, the Perfection of <em>Poetry</em>, <em>Architecture</em>, <em>Designing</em>, and such like Affairs of Genius, Taste, or Fancy: The Explications or Theories on these Subjects are in like manner full of Confusion and Metaphor.</p>"
