Nor wou'd there be any more room left in this case, either for the persuasive Rhetorick of <b>Virtue</b>, who must have already ended her Discourse, or for the insinuating Address of <b>Pleasure</b>, who having lost her Cause, must necessarily appear displeas'd, or out of humour: a Circumstance which wou'd no way sute her Character.</p>"

'Tis evident, that every Master in Painting, when he has made choice of the determinate Date or Point of Time, according to which he wou'd represent his History, is afterwards debar'd the taking advantage from any other Action than what is immediately present, and belonging to that single Instant he describes. For if he passes the present only for a moment, he may as well pass it for many years. And by this reckoning he may with as good right repeat the same Figure several times over, and in one and the same Picture represent <b>Hercules</b> in his Cradle, struggling with the Serpents; and the same <b>Hercules</b> of full Age, fighting with the <em>Hydra,</em> with <em>Anteus,</em> and with <em>Cerberus:</em> which wou'd prove a mere confus'd Heap, or Knot of Pieces, and not a single intire <em>Piece,</em> or <em>Tablature,</em> of the historical kind.</p>"

It may however be allowable, on some occasions, to make use of certain <em>enigmatical</em> or <em>emblematical</em> Devises, to represent a future Time: as when <b>Hercules</b>, yet a mere Boy, is seen holding a small Club, or wearing the Skin of a young Lion. For so we often find him in the best <em>Antiques.</em> And tho History had never related of <b>Hercules</b>, that being yet very young, he kill'd a Lion with his own hand; this Representation of him wou'd nevertheless be intirely conformable to <em>poetick Truth;</em> which not only admits, but necessarily presupposes <em>Prophecy</em> or <em>Prognostication,</em> with regard to the Actions, and Lives of Heroes and Great Men. Besides that as to our Subject, in particular, the natural Genius of <b>Hercules</b>, even in his tenderest Youth, might alone answer for his handling such Arms as these, and bearing, as it were in play, these early tokens of the future Hero.</p>"

To preserve therefore a just Conformity with <em>historical Truth,</em> and with the <em>Unity of Time</em> and <em>Action,</em> there remains no other way by which we can possibly give a hint of any thing future, or call to mind any thing past, than by setting in view such Passages or Events as have actually subsisted, or according to Nature might well subsist, or happen together in <em>one and the same</em> instant.

How is it therefore possible, says one, to express a Change of Passion in any Subject, since this Change is made by Succession; and that in this case the Passion which is understood as present, will require a Disposition of Body and Features wholly different from the Passion which is over, and past? To this we answer, That notwithstanding the Ascendency or Reign of the principal and immediate Passion, the Artist has power to leave still in his Subject the Tracts or Footsteps of its Predecessor: so as to let us behold not only a rising Passion together with a declining one; but, what is more, a strong and determinate Passion, with its contrary already discharg'd and banish'd. As for instance, when the plain Tracts of Tears new fallen, with other fresh tokens of Mourning and Dejection, remain still in a Person newly transported with Joy at the sight of a Relation or Friend, who the moment before had been lamented as one deceas'd or lost.</p>"

Again, by the same means which are employ'd to call to mind <em>the Past,</em> we may anticipate <em>the Future:</em> as wou'd be seen in the case of an able Painter, who shou'd undertake to paint this History of <b>Hercules</b> according to the third Date or Period of Time propos'd for our historical Tablature. For in this momentary Turn of Action, <b>Hercules</b> remaining still in a situation expressive of Suspense and Doubt, wou'd discover nevertheless that the Strength of this inward Conflict was over, and that Victory began now to declare her-self in favour of <em>Virtue.</em> This Transition, which seems at first so mysterious a Performance, will be easily comprehended, if one considers, That the Body, which moves much slower than the Mind, is easily out-strip'd by this latter; and that the Mind on a sudden turning it-self some new way, the nearer situated and more sprightly parts of the Body (such as the Eyes, and Muscles about the Mouth and Forehead) taking the alarm, and moving in an instant, may leave the heavier and more distant Parts to adjust them-selves, and change their Attitude some moments after.</p>"

If by any other method an Artist shou'd pretend to introduce into this Piece any portion of Time, future or past, he must either sin directly against the Law of <em>Truth</em> and <em>Credibility,</em> in representing things contrary and incompatible; or against that Law of <em>Unity</em> and <em>Simplicity of Design,</em> which constitutes the very Being of his Work. This particularly shews it-self in a Picture, when one is necessarily left in doubt, and unable to determine readily, <em>Which</em> of the distinct successive parts of the History or Action is that <em>very-one</em> represented in the Design. For even here the case is the same as in the other Circumstances of Poetry and Painting: <q>That what is principal or chief, shou'd immediately shew it-self, without leaving the Mind in any uncertainty.</q></p>"

Hardly is there any where seen a Design of this poetical History, without a ridiculous Anticipation of the <em>Metamorphosis.</em> The Horns of ACTEON, which are the Effect of a Charm, shou'd naturally wait the execution of that Act in which the Charm consists. Till the Goddess therefore has thrown her Cast, the Hero's Person suffers not any Change. Even while the Water flies, his Forehead is still sound. But in the usual Design we see it otherwise. The Horns are already <em>sprouted,</em> if not full grown: and the Goddess is seen watering <em>the Sprouts.</em></p>"
