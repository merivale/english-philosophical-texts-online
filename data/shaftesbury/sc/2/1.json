      "content": "<p>IF a Native of <b>Ethiopia</b> were on a sudden transported into <b>Europe,</b> and placed either at <b>Paris</b> or <b>Venice</b> at a time of Carnival, when the general Face of Mankind was disguis'd, and almost every Creature wore a Mask; 'tis probable he wou'd for some time be at a stand, before he discover'd the Cheat: not imagining that a whole People cou'd be so fantastical, as upon Agreement, at an appointed time, to transform themselves by a Variety of Habits, and make it a solemn Practice to impose on one another, by this universal Confusion of Characters and Persons. Tho he might at first perhaps have look'd on this with a serious eye, it wou'd be hardly possible for him to hold his Countenance, when he had perceiv'd what was carrying on. The <b>Europeans,</b> on their side, might laugh perhaps at this Simplicity. But our <b>Ethiopian</b> wou'd certainly laugh with better reason. 'Tis easy to see which of the two wou'd be ridiculous. For he who laughs, and is himself ridiculous, bears a double share of Ridicule. However, shou'd it so happen, that in the Transport of Ridicule, our <b>Ethiopian,</b> having his Head still running upon <em>Masks,</em> and knowing nothing of the <em>fair</em> Complexion and common Dress of the <b>Europeans,</b> shou'd upon the sight of a natural Face and Habit, laugh just as heartily as before; wou'd not he in his turn become ridiculous, by carrying the Jest too far; when by a silly Presumption he took <em>Nature</em> for mere <em>Art,</em> and mistook perhaps a Man of Sobriety and Sense for one of those ridiculous <em>Mummers?</em></p>"

      "content": "<p>There was a time when Men were accountable only for their Actions and Behaviour. Their Opinions were left to themselves. They had liberty to differ in these, as in their Faces. Every one took the Air and Look which was natural to him. But in process of time, it was thought decent to mend Mens Countenances, and render their intellectual Complexions uniform and of a sort. Thus the Magistrate became <em>a Dresser,</em> and in his turn was <em>dress'd</em> too, as he deserv'd; when he had given up his Power to a new Order of <em>Tire-Men.</em> But tho in this extraordinary conjuncture 'twas agreed that there was only one <em>certain</em> and <em>true Dress,</em> one <em>single</em> peculiar <em>Air,</em> to which it was necessary all People shou'd conform; yet the misery was, that neither the Magistrate nor the <em>Tire-Men</em> themselves, cou'd resolve, which of the various Modes was the <em>exact true-one.</em> Imagine now, what the Effect of this must needs be; when Men became persecuted thus on every side about their <em>Air</em> and <em>Feature,</em> and were put to their shifts how to adjust and compose their <em>Mein,</em> according to the right Mode; when a thousand Models, a thousand Patterns of Dress were current, and alter'd every now and then, upon occasion, according to <em>Fashion</em> and the Humour of the Times. Judg whether Mens Countenances were not like to grow constrain'd, and the natural Visage of Mankind, by this Habit, distorted, convuls'd, and render'd hardly knowable.</p>"

All is not <em>Fucus,</em> or mere Varnish. Nor is the Face of Truth less fair and beautiful, for all the counterfeit Vizards which have been put upon her. We must remember the <em>Carnival,</em> and what the Occasion has been of this wild Concourse and Medley; who were the Institutors of it; and to what purpose Men were thus set a-work and amus'd. We may laugh sufficiently at the original Cheat; and, if pity will suffer us, may make our-selves diversion enough with the Folly and Madness of those who are thus caught, and practis'd on, by these Impostures. But we must remember withal our <b>Ethiopian,</b> and beware, lest by taking plain Nature for a Vizard, we become more ridiculous than the People whom we ridicule. Now if a Jest or <em>Ridicule</em> thus strain'd, be capable of leading the Judgment so far astray; 'tis probable that an Excess of Fear or Horror may work the same Effect.</p>"

Your Indignation perhaps might have carry'd you to propose the razing all Monuments and Memorials of these Magicians. You might have resolv'd not to leave so much as their Houses standing. But if it had happen'd that these Magicians, in the time of their Dominion, had made any Collection of Books, or compil'd any themselves, in which they had treated of <em>Philosophy,</em> or <em>Morals,</em> or any other Science, or Part of <em>Learning;</em> wou'd you have carry'd your Resentment so far as to have extirpated these also, and condemn'd every Opinion or Doctrine they had espous'd, for no other reason than merely <em>because they had espous'd it?</em> Hardly a <b>Scythian,</b> a <b>Tartar,</b> or a <b>Goth,</b> wou'd act or reason so absurdly. Much less wou'd you (my Friend!) have carry'd on this <b>Magophony,</b> or <em>Priest-Massacre,</em> with such a barbarous Zeal. For, in good earnest, to destroy a Philosophy in hatred to a Man, implies as errant a <em>Tartar-</em>Notion, as to destroy or murder a Man in order to plunder him of his Wit, and get the inheritance of his Understanding.</p>"
