Of the former kind are either those good <em>Rusticks,</em> who have been bred remote from the form'd Societys of Men; or those plain <em>Artizans,</em> and People of lower Rank, who living in Citys and Places of resort, have been necessitated however to follow mean Imployments, and wanted the Opportunity and Means to form themselves after the better Models. There are some Persons indeed so happily form'd by Nature her-self, that with the greatest Simplicity or Rudeness of Education, they have still something of a natural Grace and Comeliness in their Action: And there are others of a better Education, who by a wrong Aim and injudicious Affectation of Grace, are of all People the farthest remov'd from it. 'Tis undeniable however, that the Perfection of Grace and Comeliness in Action and Behaviour, can be found only among the People of a liberal Education. And even among the graceful of this kind, those still are found the gracefullest, who early in their Youth have learnt their Exercises, and form'd their Motions under the best <em>Masters.</em></p>"

The Horse alone can never make <em>the Horseman;</em> nor Limbs <em>the Wrestler</em> or <em>the Dancer.</em> No more can a Genius alone make <em>a Poet;</em> or good Parts <em>a Writer,</em> in any considerable kind. The Skill and Grace of Writing is founded, as our wise Poet tells us, in <em>Knowledg</em> and <em>good Sense:</em> and not barely in that Knowledg, which is to be learnt from common Authors, or the general Conversation of the World; but from those particular Rules of Art, which Philosophy alone exhibits.</p>"

So that in this Genius of writing, there appear'd both <em>the heroick</em> and <em>the simple, the tragick,</em> and <em>the comick Vein.</em> However, it was so order'd, that notwithstanding the Oddness or Mysteriousness of the principal Character, the <em>Under-parts</em> or <em>second Characters</em> shew'd human Nature more distinctly, and to the Life.

Their <em>Mimes</em> or characteriz'd Discourses were as much relish'd, as their most regular Poems; and were the Occasion perhaps that so many of these latter were form'd in such perfection. For Poetry it-self was defin'd <em>an Imitation</em> chiefly of Men and Manners: and was that in an exalted and noble degree, which in a low one we call <em>Mimickry.</em> 'Tis in this that the great <a href=\"#n3\">[3]</a><em>Mimographer,</em> the Father and Prince of Poets, excels so highly; his Characters being wrought to a Likeness beyond what any succeeding Masters were ever able to describe. Nor are his Works, which are so full of Action, any other than an artful Series or Chain of <em>Dialogues,</em> which turn upon <em>one</em> remarkable <em>Catastrophe</em> or Event. He describes no Qualitys or Virtues; censures no Manners: makes no Encomiums, nor gives Characters himself; but brings his Actors still in view. 'Tis they who shew themselves. 'Tis they who speak in such a manner, as distinguishes 'em in all things from all others, and makes 'em ever like themselves. Their different Compositions and Allays so justly made, and equally carry'd on, thro' every particle of the Action, give more Instruction than all the Comments or Glosses in the world. The Poet, instead of giving himself those dictating and masterly Airs of Wisdom, makes hardly any figure at all, and is scarce discoverable in his Poem. This is being truly <em>a Master.</em> He paints so as to need no Inscription over his Figures, to tell us what they are, or what he intends by 'em. A few words let fall, on any slight occasion, from any of the Partys he introduces, are sufficient to denote their Manners and distinct Character. From a Finger or a Toe, he can represent to our Thoughts the Frame and Fashion of a whole Body. He wants no other help of Art, to personate his Heroes, and make 'em living. There was no more left for <em>Tragedy</em> to do after him, than to erect a Stage, and draw his Dialogues and Characters into Scenes; turning, in the same manner, upon one principal Action or Event, with that regard to Place and Time which was sutable to a real Spectacle. Even <a href=\"#n4\">[4]</a><em>Comedy</em> it-self was adjudg'd to this great Master; it being deriv'd from those <em>Parodys</em> or Mock-Humours, of which he had given the <a href=\"#n5\">[5]</a>Specimen in a conceal'd sort of Raillery intermix'd with the Sublime.—A dangerous Stroke of Art! and which requir'd a masterly Hand, like that of the philosophical Hero, whose Character was represented in the <em>Dialogue-Writings</em> above-mention'd.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The Maxim will hardly be disprov'd by Fact or History, either in respect of Philosophers themselves, or others who were the great Genius's or Masters in the liberal Arts. The Characters of the two best <em>Roman</em> Poets are well known. Those of the antient <em>Tragedians</em> no less. And the great Epick Master, tho of an obscurer and remoter Age, was ever presum'd to be far enough from a vile or knavish Character. The <em>Roman</em> as well as the <em>Grecian</em> Orator was true to his Country; and died in like manner a Martyr for its Liberty. And those Historians who are of highest value, were either in a private Life <em>approv'd good Men,</em> or noted such by their Actions in the Publick. As for Poets in particular, says the learned and wise <b>Strabo,</b> <q>Can we possibly imagine, that the Genius, Power, and Excellence of a real <em>Poet</em> consists in aught else than the just <em>Imitation</em> of Life, in form'd Discourse and Numbers? But how shou'd he be that just <em>Imitator</em> of Life, whilst he himself knows not its Measures, nor how to guide himself by Judgment and Understanding? For we have not surely the same Notion of the Poet's Excellence as of the ordinary Craftsman's, the Subject of whose Art is sensless Stone or Timber, without Life, Dignity, or Beauty: whilst the Poet's Art turning principally on Men and Manners, he has his Virtue and Excellence, <em>as Poet,</em> naturally annex'd to human Excellence, and to the Worth and Dignity of Man. Insomuch that 'tis impossible he shou'd be a great and worthy Poet, who is not first a worthy and good Man.</q> οὐ γάρ οὕτω φαμὲν τὴν τω̑ν ποιητω̑ν ἀρετὴν ὡς ἢ τεκτόνων ἢ χαλκέων, &amp;c. ἡ δὲ ποιητου̑ συνέζευκται τῃ̑ του̑ ἀνθρώπου. καὶ οὐχ οι̑όν τὲ ἀγαθὸν γενέσθαι ποιητὴν, μὴ πρότερον γενηθέντα ἄνδρα ἀγαθόν—. [For, we do not say that the virtue of the poets is like that of carpenters or blacksmiths, etc. Rather, the poet's virtue yokes itself to human virtue. And it is not possible to become a good poet, unless one first has become a good man.] Lib. 1. See <em>below,</em> pag. 278, 337 and 350, 351 in the Notes. And VOL. III. <em>pag.</em> 247, 248, 249, 273, 282.</p>"
