They deal not fairly with us, who in their philosophical Hour, admit that for <em>Pleasure,</em> which at an ordinary time, and in the common Practice of Life, is so little taken for such. The Mathematician who labours at his Problem, the bookish Man who toils, the Artist who endures voluntarily the greatest Hardships and Fatigues; none of these are said <q><em>To follow Pleasure.</em></q> Nor will the Men of Pleasure by any means admit 'em to be of their number. The Satisfactions which are <em>purely mental,</em> and depend only on the Motion of <em>a Thought;</em> must in all likelihood be too refin'd for the Apprehensions of our modern <em>Epicures,</em> who are so taken up with Pleasure of <em>a more substantial</em> kind. They who are full of the Idea of such a <em>sensible solid</em> Good, can have but a slender Fancy for the mere <em>spiritual</em> and <em>intellectual</em> sort. But 'tis this latter they set up and magnify upon occasion; to save the Ignominy which may redound to 'em from the former. This done, the latter may take its chance: Its Use is presently at an end. For 'tis observable, that when the Men of this sort have recommended the Enjoyments of the Mind under the title of <em>Pleasure;</em> when they have thus dignify'd the Word, and included in it whatever is mentally good or excellent, they can afterwards suffer it contentedly to slide down again into its own genuine and vulgar Sense; whence they rais'd it only to serve a turn. When <em>Pleasure</em> is call'd in question, and attack'd, then <em>Reason</em> and <em>Virtue</em> are call'd in to her Aid, and made principal parts of her Constitution. A complicated Form appears, and comprehends straight all which is generous, honest, and beautiful in human Life. But when the Attack is over, and the Objection once solv'd, the Specter vanishes: <em>Pleasure</em> returns again to her former Shape: She may e'en be <em>Pleasure</em> still, and have as little concern with <em>dry sober Reason,</em> as in the nature of the thing, and according to common Understanding, she really has. For if this rational sort of Enjoyment be admitted into the Notion of <em>Good,</em> how is it possible to admit withal that kind of Sensation, which in effect is rather opposite to this Enjoyment? 'Tis certain that in respect of the Mind and its Enjoyments, the Eagerness and Irritation of <em>mere Pleasure,</em> <label>Pleasure and Pain.</label> is as disturbing as the Importunity and Vexation of <em>Pain.</em> If <em>either</em> throws the Mind off its biass, and deprives it of the Satisfaction it takes in its natural Exercise and Employment; the Mind in this case must be Sufferer as well by one as by the other.
