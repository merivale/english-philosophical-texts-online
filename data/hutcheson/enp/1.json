Tho it is not easy to assign accurate Divisions on such Subjects, yet we may reduce them to the following Classes, leaving it to others to arrange them as they think convenient. A little Reflection will [5] shew that there are such <em>Natural</em> [<em>5</em>] <em>Powers</em> in the human Mind, in whatever Order we place them. In the 1st Class are the <em>External Senses,</em> universally known. In the 2d, the <em>Pleasant Perceptions</em> arising from <em>regular, harmonious, uniform</em> Objects; as also from <em>Grandeur</em> and <em>Novelty.</em> These we may call, after Mr. <b>Addison,</b> the Pleasures of the <em>Imagination;</em> <a href=\"#n3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> or we may call the Power of receiving them, an <em>Internal Sense.</em> Whoever dislikes this Name may substitute another. 3. The next Class of Perceptions we may call a <em>Publick Sense, viz.</em> <q>our Determination to be pleased with the <em>Happiness</em> of others, and to be uneasy at their <em>Misery.</em></q> This is found in some degree in all Men, and was sometimes called Ḱοινονοημοσύνη or <em>Sensus Communis</em><a href=\"#n4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> by some of the Antients. 4. The fourth Class we may call the <em>Moral</em> [6] <em>Sense,</em> by which <q>we perceive <em>Virtue,</em> or <em>Vice</em> in our selves, or others.</q> This is plainly distinct from the former Class of Perceptions, since many are strongly affected with the Fortunes of others, who seldom reflect upon <em>Virtue,</em> or <em>Vice</em> in themselves, or others, as an Object: as we may find in <em>Natural Affection, Compassion, Friendship,</em> or even <em>general Benevolence</em> to Mankind, which connect our Happiness or Pleasure with that of others, even when we are not reflecting upon our own Temper, nor delighted with the Perception of our own Virtue. 5. The fifth [<em>6</em>] Class is a <em>Sense of Honour,</em> <q>which makes the <em>Approbation,</em> or <em>Gratitude</em> of others, for any good Actions we have done, the necessary occasion of Pleasure; and their <em>Dislike, Condemnation,</em> or <em>Resentment</em> of Injuries done by us, the occasion of that uneasy Sensation called <em>Shame,</em> even when we fear no further evil from them.</q></p>"

The Division of our <em>External Senses</em> into the five common Classes, is ridiculously imperfect. Some <em>Sensations,</em> received without any previous Idea, can either be reduced to none of them, such as the Sensations of <em>Hunger, Thirst, Weariness, Sickness;</em> or if we reduce them to the Sense of <em>Feeling,</em> they are Perceptions as different from the other <em>Ideas</em> of Touch, such as <em>Cold, Heat, Hardness, Softness,</em> as the <em>Ideas</em> of <em>Taste</em> or <em>Smell.</em> Others have hinted at an External Sense different from all of these. The following general Account may possibly be useful. (1.) That certain Motions raised in our Bodies are by a <em>general Law</em> constituted the Occasion of <em>Perceptions</em> in the Mind. (2.) These Perceptions never come entirely alone, but have some other <em>Perception</em> joined with them. Thus every Sensation is accompanied with the <em>Idea</em> of <em>Duration,</em> and yet <em>Duration</em> is not a sensible <em>Idea,</em> since it also accompanies <em>Ideas</em> of <em>Internal Consciousness</em> or Reflection: So the <em>Idea</em> of <em>Number</em> may accompany any sensible Ideas, and yet may also accompany any other Ideas, as well as external Sensations. (3.) Some <em>Ideas</em> are found accompanying the most different Sensations, which yet are not to be perceived separately from some <em>sensible Quality;</em> such are <em>Extension, Figure, Motion,</em> and <em>Rest,</em> which accompany the <em>Ideas</em> of Sight, or Colours, and yet may be perceived without them, as in the <em>Ideas</em> of <em>Touch,</em> at least if we move our Organs along the Parts of the Body touched. <em>Extension, Figure, Motion,</em> or <em>Rest</em> seem therefore to be more properly called <em>Ideas accompanying</em> the Sensations of <em>Sight</em> and <em>Touch,</em> than the Sensations of either of these Senses. The <em>Perceptions</em> which are purely sensible, received each by its proper Sense, are <em>Tastes, Smells, colours, Sound, Cold, Heat,</em> &amp;c. The universal Concomitant <em>Ideas</em> which may attend any <em>Idea</em> whatsoever, are <em>Duration,</em> and <em>Number.</em> The <em>Ideas</em> which accompany the most different Sensations, are <em>Extension, Figure, Motion, Rest.</em> These all arise without any previous <em>Ideas</em> assembled, or compared: the Concomitant <em>Ideas</em> are reputed Images of something External.</p><p>From all these we may justly distinguish <q>the Pleasures perceived upon the previous Reception and Comparison of various sensible Perceptions, with their concomitant Ideas, or intellectual Ideas, when we find Uniformity, or Resemblance among them.</q> These are meant by <em>the Perceptions of the internal Sense.</em></p>"
