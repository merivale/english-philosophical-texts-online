Some pursue, or seem to pursue only the Pleasures of the <em>external Senses,</em> and all other Pursuits are made subservient to them: Others are chiefly set upon the Pleasures of <em>Imagination</em> or <em>internal Senses; social</em> and <em>kind Affections</em> employ another sort, who seem indifferent to all private Pleasure: This last Temper has generally joined with it an high <em>moral Sense,</em> and <em>Love of Honour.</em> We may sometimes find an high <em>Sense of Honour</em> and desire of <em>Applause,</em> where there is indeed a <em>moral Sense,</em> but a very weak one, very much perverted, so as to be influenced by <em>popular Opinion,</em> and made subservient to it: In this <em>Character</em> the Pleasures of the external Senses, or even of the Imagination, have little room, except so far as they may produce <em>Distinction.</em> Now upon comparing the several Pleasures, perhaps the Sentence of the <em>Luxurious</em> [129] would be quite opposite [<em>128</em>] to that of the <em>Virtuous.</em> The <em>Ambitious</em> would differ from both. Those who are devoted to the <em>internal Senses</em> or <em>Imagination,</em> would differ from all the three. The <em>Miser</em> would applaud himself in his Wealth above them all. Is there therefore no disputing about Tastes? Are all Persons alike happy, who obtain the several Enjoyments for which they have a Relish? If they are, the Dispute is at an end: A Fly or Maggot in its proper haunts, is as happy as a <em>Hero,</em> or <em>Patriot,</em> or <em>Friend,</em> who has newly delivered his <em>Country</em> or <em>Friend,</em> and is surrounded with their grateful <em>Praises.</em> The <em>Fly</em> or <em>Maggot</em> may think so of itself; but who will stand to its Judgment, when we are sure that it has experienced only one sort of Pleasure, and is a stranger to the others? May we not in like manner find some Reasons of <em>appealing</em> from the Judgment of certain Men? Or may not some <em>Characters</em> be found among Men, who alone are capable of judging in this matter?</p>"

The external Senses represent these Objects in the same manner, when they are conquered.

The Expences of <em>Generosity, Humanity, Charity</em> and <em>Compassion</em> are allowed, even when yielded to Virtue, to be known to the full. But the moral Sense, weak as it often is, does not yield even to known <em>external Pleasure, Ease or Advantage:</em> but, where there is a depraved <em>Taste,</em> and a weak <em>Understanding,</em> private Advantage, or the avoiding of some external Evil, may make Actions appear <em>innocent,</em> which are not; and then the moral Sense gives no Opposition.

Thus, some parts of a well baked loaf will crack and become rugged. What is thus cleft beyond the design of the baker, looks well, and invites the appetite. So when figs are at the ripest, they begin to crack. Thus in full ripe olives, their approach to putrefication gives the proper beauty to the fruit. Thus, the laden'd ear of corn hanging down, the stern brow of the lyon, and the foam flowing from the mouth of the wild boar, and many other things, considered apart, have nothing comely; yet because of their connexion with things natural, they adorn them, and delight the spectator. Thus, to one who has a deep affection of soul, and penetration into the constitution of the whole, scarce any thing connected with nature will fail to recommend itself agreeably to him. Thus, the real vast jaws of savage beasts will please him, no less than the imitations of them by painters or statuaries. With like pleasure will his chaste eyes behold the maturity and grace of old age in man or woman, and the inviting charms of youth. Many such things will he experience, not credible to all, but only those who have the genuine affection of soul toward nature and its works,</q> James Moor and Francis Hutcheson (trans.), <em>The Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus,</em> 76–77.]]</p>"
