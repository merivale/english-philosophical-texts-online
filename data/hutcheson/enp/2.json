The first which occur to any one are <em>Desire</em> of the grateful Perceptions, and <em>Aversion</em> to the uneasy, either for our selves or others. If we would confine the word <em>Affection</em> to these two, which are entirely distinct from all <em>Sensation,</em> and directly incline the Mind to <em>Action</em> or <em>Volition of Motion,</em> we should have no Debate about the Number or Division of <em>Affections.</em> But since, by universal Custom, this Name is applied to other Modifications of the Mind, such as <em>Joy, Sorrow, Despair,</em> we may consider what universal <em>Distinction</em> can be assigned between these <em>Modifications,</em> and the several <em>Sensations</em> abovementioned; and we shall scarce find any other than this, that we call <q>the <em>direct immediate Perception</em> of Pleasure or Pain from [28] the present [<em>28</em>] Object or Event, the <em>Sensation:</em></q><label><span>Affection distinct from Passion.</span></label> But we denote by the <em>Affection</em> or <em>Passion</em> some other <q><em>Perceptions</em> of Pleasure or Pain, not directly raised by the <em>Presence</em> or <em>Operation</em> of the Event or Object, but by our <em>Reflection</em> upon, or <em>Apprehension</em> of their present or certainly future Existence; so that we are sure that the Object or Event will raise the <em>direct Sensations</em> in us.</q> In beholding a regular Building we have the <em>Sensation</em> of Beauty; but upon our <em>apprehending</em> our selves possessed of it, or that we can procure this pleasant Sensation when we please, we feel the <em>Affection</em> of <em>Joy.</em> When a Man has a Fit of the Gout, he has the <em>painful Sensation;</em> when he is not at present pained, yet apprehends a sudden return of it, he has the <em>Affection of Sorrow,</em> which might in some sense also be called a Sensation.</p>"

In the <em>Elucidation,</em> Malebranche distinguishes between two kinds of pleasures: pleasures of the body and pleasures of the soul.
