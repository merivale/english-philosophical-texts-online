These Conceptions only serve to suggest <em>greater Ends</em> than would occur to us without Reflection; and by the <em>Prepollency</em> of one Desire toward the <em>greater Good,</em> either private or publick, to stop the Desire toward the <em>smaller Good,</em> when it appears inconsistent with the greater.</p>"
