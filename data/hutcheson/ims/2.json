Thus every <em>extended Being</em> may be compared to any other of the same <em>Kinds of Dimensions;</em> and <em>relative Ideas</em> be formed of <em>greater, less, equal, double, triple, subduple,</em> &amp;c. with infinite variety. This may let us see that Relations are not <em>real Qualities</em> inherent in external Natures, but only <em>Ideas</em> necessarily accompanying our <em>Perception</em> of two Objects at once, and comparing them. <em>Relative Ideas</em> do continue, when the external [<em>247</em>] Objects do not exist, provided [252] we retain the <em>two Ideas.</em> But what the <em>eternal Relations</em> in the Natures of Things do mean, is not so easy perhaps to be conceived.</p>"
