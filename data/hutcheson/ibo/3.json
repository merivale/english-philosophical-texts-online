Thus for instance, the 47<em>th</em> Proposition of the first <em>Book</em> of <u><b>Euclid</b></u>'s <cite>Elements</cite> contains an infinite Multitude of Truths, concerning the infinite possible <em>Sizes</em> of right-angled <em>Triangles</em>, as you make the <em>Area</em> greater or less; and in each of these <em>Sizes</em> you may find an infinite Multitude of dissimilar <em>Triangles</em>, as you vary the Proportion of the <em>Base</em> to the <em>Perpendicular</em>; all which Infinitys of Infinites agree in the general <em>Theorem</em>. In <em>Algebraick</em>, and <em>Fluxional Calculations</em>, we shall still find a greater <em>Variety</em> of particular <em>Truths</em> included in general <em>Theorems</em>; not only in general <em>Equations</em> applicable to all Kinds of <em>Quantity</em>, but in more particular Investigations of <em>Areas</em> and <em>Tangents</em>: In which one Manner of Operation shall discover <em>Theorems</em> applicable to infinite <em>Orders</em> or <em>Species</em> of <em>Curves</em>, to the infinite <em>Sizes</em> of each Species, and to the infinite <em>Points</em> of the infinite <em>Individuals</em> of each Size.</p>"

Now each of these Trials discovers a new Truth, but with no Pleasure or <em>Beauty</em>, notwithstanding the <em>Variety</em>, till we can discover some sort of <em>Unity</em>, or reduce them to some general Canon.</p>"

For tho' this Proposition contains many Infinitys of particular Truths; yet the <em>Unity</em> is inconsiderable, since they all agree only in a vague, undetermin'd Conception of <em>Whole</em> and <em>Part</em>, and in an indefinite Excess of the former above the latter, which is sometimes great and sometimes small. So, should we hear that the <em>Cylinder</em> is greater than the inscrib'd <em>Sphere</em>, and this again greater than the <em>Cone</em> of the same Altitude and Diameter with the Base, we shall find no pleasure in this Knowledge of a general Relation of greater and less, without any precise Difference or Proportion. But when we see the universal exact Agreement of all possible Sizes of such Systems of Solids, that they preserve to each other the constant <em>Ratio</em> of 3, 2, 1; how beautiful is the <em>Theorem</em>, and how are we ravish'd with its first Discovery!</p>"

These Truths we almost know <em>Intuitively</em>, without Demonstration: They are like common <em>Goods</em>, or those which Men have long possessed, which do not give such sensible Joys as much smaller new <em>Additions</em> may give us. But let none hence imagine, that the sole Pleasure of Theorems is from <em>Surprize</em>; for the same <em>Novelty</em> of a single Experiment does not please us much: nor ought we to conclude from the greater Pleasure accompanying a <em>new</em>, or <em>unexpected</em> Advantage, that <em>Surprize</em>, or <em>Novelty</em> is the only Pleasure of Life, or the only ground of Delight in <em>Truth</em>. Another kind of Surpirze in certain Theorems increases our Pleasure above what we have in Theorems of greater Extent; when we discover a <em>general Truth</em>, which upon some confused Notion we had reputed false: as that <em>Assymptotes always approaching should never meet the Curve</em>. This is like the Joy of unexpected Advantage where we dreaded Evil. But still the <em>Unity</em> of many Particulars in the general Theorem is necessary to give Pleasure in any Theorem.</p>"

'Twas this probably which set <u><b>Descartes</b></u> on that hopeful Project of deducing all human Knowledge from one Proposition, <em>viz.</em> <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>; while others with as little Sense contended, that <i>Impossibile est idem simul esse &amp; non esse</i>, had much fairer Pretensions to the Style and Title of <i>Principium humanae Cognitionis absolut√® primum</i>. <u>Mr. <b>Leibnitz</b></u> had an equal Affection for his favourite Principle of a <em>sufficient Reason</em> for every thing in <em>Nature</em>, and brags to <u>Dr. <b>Clarke</b></u> of the Wonders he had wrought in the intellectual World by its Assistance; but his learned Antagonist seems to think he had not sufficient Reason for his Boasting<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. If we look into particular Sciences, we may see in the Systems learned Men have given us of them, the Inconveniences of this Love of <em>Uniformity</em>. How aukwardly is <u><b>Puffendorf</b></u> forc'd to deduce the several Dutys of Men to <em>God</em>, <em>themselves</em>, and their <em>Neighbours</em>, from his single fundamental Principle of <em>Sociableness to the whole Race of Mankind</em>? This Observation might easily be extended farther, were it necessary; and is a strong Proof, that Men perceive the <em>Beauty of Uniformity</em> in the Sciences, even from the Contortions of common Sense they are led into by pursuing it.</p>"

And however Knowledge enlarges the <em>Mind</em>, and makes us more capable of comprehensive Views and Projects in some kinds of Business, whence <em>Advantage</em> may also arise to us; yet we may leave it in the Breast of every Student to determine, whether he has not often felt this Pleasure without any such prospect of Advantage from the Discovery of his <em>Theorem</em>. All which can thence be infer'd is only this, that as in our external Senses, so in our <em>internal</em> ones, the pleasant Sensations generally arise from those Objects which calm Reason would have recommended, had we understood their Use, and which might have engag'd our pursuits from <em>Self-Interest</em>.</p>"

As there is a great Diversity of Proportions possible, and different Kinds of <em>Uniformity</em>, so there is room enough for that Diversity of Fancys observable in <em>Architecture</em>, <em>Gardening</em>, and such like Arts in different <em>Nations</em>; they all may have <em>Uniformity</em>, tho' the Parts in one may differ from those in another. The <em>Chinese</em> or <em>Persian</em> Buildings are not like the <em>Grecian</em> and <em>Roman</em>, and yet the former has its <em>Uniformity</em> of the various Parts to each other, and to the Whole, as well as the latter. In that kind of Architecture which the <b>Europeans</b> call <em>Regular</em>, the <em>Uniformity</em> of Parts is very obvious, the several Parts are <em>regular Figures</em>, and either <em>equal</em> or <em>similar</em> at least in the same Range; the Pedestals are <em>Parallelopipedons</em> or square <em>Prisms</em>; the Pillars, <em>Cylinders</em> nearly; the Arches <em>circular</em>, and all those in the same Row <em>equal</em>; there is the same Proportion every-where observ'd in the same Range between the <em>Diameters</em> of Pillars and their <em>Heights</em>, their <em>Capitals</em>, the <em>Diameters</em> of <em>Arches</em>, the <em>Heights</em> of the <em>Pedestals</em>, the <em>Projections</em> of the <em>Cornice</em>, and all the Ornaments in each of our <em>five Orders</em>. And tho' other Countrys do not follow the <em>Grecian</em> or <em>Roman</em> Proportions; yet there is even among them a Proportion retain'd, a <em>Uniformity</em>, and Resemblance of corresponding Figures; and every Deviation in one part from that Proportion which is observ'd in the rest of the Building, is displeasing to every Eye, and destroys or diminishes at least the <em>Beauty</em> of the Whole.</p>"
