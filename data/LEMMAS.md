# Lemmas

## Ambiguous Words

The following words are ambiguous in the very precise and minimal sense that they correspond to more than one lemma. To disambiguate, the first of each form listed here is stored in the textual database with an underscore at the end. These underscores are used by the lemmatization lookup to disambiguate, but are removed when displaying the text for reading.

N.B. No attempts are made to disambiguate words more generally. For example, the words "alarm" and "alarms" both map to the same lemma "alarm", even though both may occur as either a verb or a noun. Disambiguation on a larger scale would be unfeasible, and is kept to an absolute minimum here.

- "art": archaic form of "be" ("thou art") / singular noun
- "flatter": comparative of adjective "flat" / base of verb "flatter"
- "left": adjective / past of verb "leave"
- "lent": singular noun of "lent" / past of verb "lend"
- "lives": plural of noun "life" / present of verb "live"
- "might": noun / past of modal "may"
- "thought": singular of noun "thought" / past of verb "think"

## Spaced Words

Some Latin phrases occur in English only as pairs, and should be treated as single words. These are stored in the textual database as single words, i.e. without a space between them, and the space is reinserted when displaying the text for reading.

- "a priori"
- "a posteriori"
- "ad infinitum"
- "in infinitum"
- "ipso facto"
