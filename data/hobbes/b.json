  "comments": "Hobbes's history of the English Civil Wars was first published in 1679. A posthumous edition was printed in 1682, claiming to be derived from the author's own copy, and to be much more accurate. So far as we are aware this claim is to be taken at face value, and consequently this edition has been chosen as our copytext.",
