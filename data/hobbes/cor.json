  "comments": "<i>De Corpore</i> was first published in Latin in 1655, and then published in English in 1656, as <i>The Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body</i>. Our copytext is this first English edition. As the English title indicates, it was apparently conceived as the first part of a larger work. Part 2, <i>De Homine</i>, was published in Latin in 1658, but never appeared in English translation (and is therefore not included on this site). Part 3, <i>De Cive</i>, was in fact the first part Hobbes wrote, and was published in Latin in 1642. It was also the first to appear in translation, published in 1651 as <a href=\"/browse/hobbes/civ\"><i>Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and Society</i></a>.",
