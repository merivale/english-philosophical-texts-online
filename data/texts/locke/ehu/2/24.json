Nor is it harder to conceive, how an Army of ten Thousand Men, should make one <em>Idea,</em> than how a Man should make one <em>Idea</em>; it being as easie to the Mind, to unite into one, the <em>Idea</em> of a great number of Men, and consider it as one; as it is to unite into one particular, all the distinct <em>Ideas,</em> that make up the composition of a Man, and consider them altogether as one</p>"

For there are no Things so remote, nor so contrary, which the Mind cannot, by this art of Composition, bring into one <em>Idea,</em> as is visible in that signified by the name <em>Universe.</em></p>"
