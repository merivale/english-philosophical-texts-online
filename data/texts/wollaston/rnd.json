  "comments": "The first edition of <i>The Religion of Nature Delineated</i> was published in 1722, but was (according to the advertisement to the second 1724 edition) &ldquo;transcribed for the press hastily&rdquo;, and contained &ldquo;many <em>errata</em> and mistakes&rdquo;. Our copytext is therefore this second edition, the last to be printed in Wollaston&rsquo;s lifetime. The text here derives from Stanley Tweyman's edition (Delmar, New York: Scholars&lsquo; Facsimiles and Reprints).",
