  "comments": "Berkeley’s <i>Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge</i> was first published in 1710, and then again in 1734 together with the <i>Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous</i>. Our copytext is this later edition, which corrects a few typographical errors, makes some small stylistic improvements, and uses more modern spelling. Where the 1734 edition has ‘humane knowledge’, however, and the 1710 edition has ‘human knowlege’, we have preferred ‘human knowledge’, which we presume to be easier on the eye of modern readers.",
