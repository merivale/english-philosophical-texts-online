By a Law of <em>Lycurgus,</em> it was enacted, That the Cielings of the <em>Spartan Houses</em> should only be wrought by the Ax, and their Gates and Doors only smoothed by the Saw; and this, says <em>Plutarch,</em> was not without Mystery; for if <em>Epaminondas</em> could say with so good a Grace, inviting some of his Friends to his Table; <em>Come, Gentlemen, be secure, Treason would never come to such a poor Dinner as this:</em> Why might not this great Law-giver, in all Probability, have thought, that such ill favour'd Houses would never be capable of receiving Luxury and Superfluity?</p>"
