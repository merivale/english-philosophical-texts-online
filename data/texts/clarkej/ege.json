The text here derives from Stanley Tweyman&lsquo;s edition of the latter (Delmar, New York: Scholars&lsquo; Facsimiles and Reprints), which includes Clarke&lsquo;s criticism, as well as an anonymous defence of Wollaston written in response to Clarke (also published in 1725; Wollaston himself died in 1724).",
