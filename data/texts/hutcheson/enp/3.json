About Good we have these two, <i>Libido &amp; Lætitia</i>, <em>Desire</em> and <em>Joy</em>: About Evil we have likewise two, <i>Metus &amp; Ægritudo</i>, <em>Fear</em> and <em>Sorrow</em>. To this general Division he subjoins many <em>Subdivisions</em> of each of these four Passions; according as in the <em>Latin</em> Tongue they had different Names for the several <em>Degrees</em> of these Passions, or for the same Passion employed upon different Objects.

These Objects or Actions are generally, tho' not always, in effect the <em>Means</em> of some Good; but we are determined to them even without this Conception of them. Thus, as we observed above,<a href=\"#n3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the <em>Propensity to Fame</em> may continue after one has lost all notion of <em>Good</em>, either publick or private, which could be the Object of a distinct Desire. Our <em>particular Affections</em> have generally some of these <em>Propensities</em> accompanying them; but these Propensities are sometimes without the Affections or distinct Desires, and have a stronger Influence upon the Generality of Men, than the Affections could have alone. Thus in Anger, beside the Intention of removing the uneasy Sensation from the Injury received; beside the Desire of obtaining a Reparation of it, and Security for the future, which are some sort of <em>Goods</em> intended by Men when they are calm, as well as during the Passion, there is in the passionate Person a Propensity to occasion <em>Misery</em> to the Offender, a Determination to <em>Violence</em>, even where there is no <em>Intention</em> of any Good to be obtained, or Evil avoided by this Violence. <label>Anger.</label> And it is principally this Propensity which we denote by the Name <em>Anger</em>, tho' other Desires may often accompany it.</p>"

These <em>Propensities</em>, along with the Sensations above-mentioned, when they occur without rational Desire, we may call <em>Passions</em>, and when they happen along with Desires, denominate them <em>passionate</em>. This part of our Constitution is as intelligible as many others universally observed and acknowledged; such as these, that Danger of falling makes us stretch out our Arms; noise makes us wink; that a Child is determined to suck; many other Animals to rise up and walk; some to run into Water, before they can have any Notion of Good to be obtained, or Evil avoided by these means.</p>"

And further, the Passions in both Cases are either <em>stopped</em>, or turned the contrary way, by want of due <em>Proportion</em> between the <em>State</em> and <em>Character</em>. Thus an imperfect good Character, in pursuit of a Good too great for his Virtue, or to the exclusion of more worthy Characters, instead of raising <em>Desire</em> of his Success, raises <em>Aversion</em>; <label>Envy, Sorrow, Joy.</label> his Success raises <em>Envy</em>, or a Species of <em>Sorrow</em>, and his Disappointment <em>Joy</em>. An imperfectly evil Character, threatned by an Evil greater than is necessary to make him relent and reform, or by a great Calamity, which has no direct tendency to reform him, instead of raising <em>Desire</em> toward the Event, raises <em>Aversion</em>; <label>Pity.</label> his escaping it raises <em>Joy</em>, and his falling under it raises <em>Pity</em> a Species of Sorrow.</p>"

When an imperfect good Character, by an evil Action, procures the highest Misery to himself; this raises these complicated Passions, <em>Pity</em> toward the Sufferer, <em>Sorrow</em> for the State, <em>Abhorrence</em> of Vice, <em>Awe</em> and <em>Admiration</em> of Providence, as keeping strict Measures of Sanctity and Justice. These Passions we may all feel, in reading <cite>the <em>Oedipus</em> of <em>Sophocles</em></cite>, when we see the Distress of that Prince, occasioned by his superstitious Curiosity about his future Fortunes; his rash Violence of Temper, in Duelling without Provocation, and in pronouncing Execrations on Persons unknown. We feel the like Passions from the Fortunes of <u><em>Creon</em></u> in <cite>the <em>Antigone</em></cite>; or from the Fates of <u><em>Pyrrhus</em></u> and <u><em>Orestes</em></u>, in <cite>the <em>Andromache of Racine</em></cite>; or our <cite><em>Distressed Mother</em></cite>. We heartily pity these Characters, but without repining at Providence; their Misery is the Fruit of their own Actions. It is with the justest Reason, that <u><em>Aristotle</em></u><a href=\"#n6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> prefers such Plots to all others for <em>Tragedy</em>, since these Characters come nearest to those of the Spectators, and consequently will have the strongest Influence on them. We are generally conscious of some good Dispositions, mixed with many Weaknesses: few imagine themselves capable of attaining the <em>height</em> of perfectly good Characters, or arriving to their high Degrees of Felicity; and fewer imagine themselves capable of sinking into the Baseness of perfectly <em>evil Tempers</em>, and therefore few dread the Calamities which befal them.</p>"
