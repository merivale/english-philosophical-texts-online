Must Men know the Schemes of the <em>Moralists</em> and <em>Politicians</em>, or the <em>Art</em> of <em>Rhetorick</em>, to be capable of being persuaded? Must they be nicely conversant in all the Methods of promoting <em>Self-Interest</em>? Nay, do we not see on the contrary, the <em>rude undisciplin'd Multitude</em> most affected? Where had <em>Oratory</em> so much Power as in <em>popular States</em>, and that too before the Perfection of the Sciences? <em>Reflection</em> and <em>Study</em> may raise in Men a Suspicion of Design, and Caution of Assent, when they have some Knowledge of the various Topicks of Argument, and find them employ'd upon themselves: but <em>rude Nature</em> is still open to every <em>moral</em> Impression, and carry'd furiously along without Caution, or Suspense. It was not the <em>Groves</em> of the <em>Academy</em>, or the <em>polish'd Stones</em> of the <em>Portico</em>, or the <em>manag'd Horses</em> of <b>Greece</b>, which listen'd to the Harp of an <u><b>Amphion</b></u>, or an <u><b>Orpheus</b></u>; but the <em>Trees</em>, and <em>Rocks</em>, and <em>Tygers</em> of the <em>Forest</em>: which may shew us, <q>That there is some <em>Sense</em> of <em>Morality</em> antecedent to Instruction, or metaphysical Arguments proving the <em>private Interest</em> of the Person who is persuaded, to be connected with the <em>publick Good</em>.</q></p>"

For we join the Contemplation of <em>moral Circumstances</em> and <em>Qualitys</em>, along with <em>natural Objects</em>, to increase their <em>Beauty</em> or <em>Deformity</em>; and we affect the <em>Hearer</em> in a more lively manner with the Affections describ'd, by representing them as <em>Persons</em>. Thus a shady Wood must have its <em>solemn venerable Genius</em>, and proper <em>rural Gods</em>; every clear Fountain, its <em>sacred chaste Nymph</em>; and River, its <em>bountiful God</em>, with his <em>Urn</em>, and perhaps a <em>Cornucopiæ</em> diffusing <em>Plenty</em> and <em>Fruitfulness</em> along its Banks. The <em>Day-light</em> is <em>holy</em>, <em>benign</em>, and <em>powerful</em> to banish the pernicious Spirits of the <em>Night</em>. The Morning is a <em>kind officious Goddess</em>, <em>tripping</em> over the dewy Mountains, and <em>ushering</em> in Light to <em>Gods</em> and <em>Men</em>. War is an <em>impetuous</em>, <em>cruel</em>, <em>undistinguishing Monster</em>, whom no <em>Virtue</em>, no Circumstance of <em>Compassion</em>, can move from his bloody Purposes. The Steel is <em>unrelenting</em>; the Arrow and Spear are <em>impatient</em> to destroy, and carry <em>Death</em> on their Points. Our modern Engines of War are also <em>frightful Personages</em>, counterfeiting with their rude Throats the Thunder of <u><b>Jove</b></u>. The <em>moral Imagery</em> of <em>Death</em> is every-where known, <em>viz.</em> his <em>Insensibility</em> to <em>Pity</em>, his <em>Inflexibility</em>, and <em>universal impartial Empire</em>. <b>Fortune</b> is inimitably drawn by <u><b>Horace</b></u><a href=\"#n10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a>, with all her <em>Retinue</em> and <em>Votaries</em>, and with her <em>rigid severe</em> Minister, <em>Necessity</em>.

Nay, the <em>most sacred Poets</em> are often led into this <em>Imagery</em>, and represent <em>Justice</em> and <em>Judgment</em> as <em>supporting</em> the <b>Almighty</b>'s Throne, and <em>Mercy</em> and <em>Truth</em> <em>going</em> before his Face: They shew us <em>Peace</em> as <em>springing</em> up from the Earth, and <em>Mercy</em> <em>looking</em> down from Heaven.</p>"
