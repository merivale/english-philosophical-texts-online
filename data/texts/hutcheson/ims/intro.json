And that, in like manner, what determines any Agent to <em>approve</em> his own Action, is its <em>Tendency to his private Happiness</em> in the whole, tho' it may bring <em>present Pain</em> along with it: That the <em>Approbation</em> of the Action of another, is from an Opinion of its Tendency to the Happiness of the <em>Approver</em>, either <em>immediately</em> or more <em>remotely</em>: That each Agent may discover it to be the surest way to promote his private Happiness, to do <em>publickly useful Actions</em>, and to abstain from those which are <em>publickly hurtful</em>: That the neglecting to observe this, and doing <em>publickly hurtful Actions</em>, does mischief to the whole of Mankind, by hurting any one part; that every one has some little <em>damage</em> by this Action: Such an <em>inadvertent Person</em> might possibly be <em>pernicious</em> to any one, were he in his Neighbourhood; and the very <em>Example</em> of such Actions may extend over the whole World, and produce some pernicious Effects upon any Observer. That therefore every one may look upon such Actions as <em>hurtful to himself</em>, and in this view does disapprove them, and hates the Agent. In the like manner, a <em>publickly useful Action</em> may diffuse some small <em>Advantage</em> to every Observer, whence he may <em>approve</em> it, and <em>love</em> the Agent.</q></p>"

Men are conscious of no such Intentions or <em>acute Reflections</em> about these Actions.
