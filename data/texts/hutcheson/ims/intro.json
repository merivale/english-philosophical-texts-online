Our <em>Christian Moralists</em> introduce other sorts of Happiness to be desired, but still <q> 'tis the <em>Prospect of private Happiness,</em> which, with some of them, is the sole <em>Motive of Election.</em> And that, in like manner, what determines any Agent to <em>approve</em> his own Action, is its <em>Tendency to his private Happiness</em> in the whole, tho it may bring <em>present Pain</em> along with it: That the <em>Approbation</em> of the Action of another, is from an Opinion of its Tendency to the Happiness of the <em>Approver,</em> either <em>immediately</em> or more <em>remotely:</em> That each Agent may discover it to be the surest way to promote his private Happiness, to do <em>publickly useful Actions,</em> and to abstain from those which are <em>publickly hurtful:</em> That the neglecting to observe this, and doing <em>publickly hurtful Actions,</em> does mischief to the whole of Mankind, by hurting any one part; that every one has some little <em>damage</em> by this Action: Such an <em>inadvertent Person</em> might possibly be <em>pernicious</em> to any one, were he in his Neighbourhood; and the very <em>Example</em> of such Actions may extend over the whole World, and produce some pernicious Effects upon any Observer. That therefore every one may look upon such Actions as <em>hurtful to himself,</em> and in this view does disapprove them, and hates the Agent. In the like manner, a <em>publickly useful Action</em> may diffuse some small <em>Advantage</em> to every Observer, whence he may <em>approve</em> it, and <em>love</em> the Agent.</q></p>"

Ingenious speculative Men, in their straining to support an <em>Hypothesis,</em> may contrive a thousand <em>subtle selfish Motives,</em> which a kind generous Heart never dreamed of. In like manner, this Scheme can never account for the sudden <em>Approbation,</em> and violent <em>Sense</em> of something amiable in Actions done in distant Ages and Nations, while the Approver has perhaps never thought of these distant <em>Tendencies</em> to his Happiness. Nor will it better account for our <em>want of Approbation</em> toward <em>publickly useful Actions</em> done <em>casually,</em> or only with Intention of <em>private Happiness</em> to the Agent.
