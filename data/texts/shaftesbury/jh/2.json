For in the manner of his turn towards the worthier of these Goddesses, he shou'd by no means appear so averse or separate from the other, as not to suffer it to be conceiv'd of him, that he had ever any inclination for her, or had ever hearken'd to her Voice. On the contrary, there ought to be some hopes yet remaining for this latter Goddess <b>Pleasure</b>, and some regret apparent in <b>Hercules</b>. Otherwise we shou'd pass immediately from the <em>third</em> to the <em>fourth</em> Period; or at least confound one with the other.</p>"

Here the Interest of <b>Hercules</b> himself is at stake. 'Tis <em>his own</em> Cause which is trying.

If the latter be us'd, then the reluctant Passion, which is not yet wholly overcome, may shew it-self in Pity and Tenderness, mov'd in our Hero by the thought of those Pleasures and Companions of his Youth, which he is going for ever to abandon. And in this sense <b>Hercules</b> may look either on the one or the other of the Goddesses, with this difference; That if he looks on <em>Pleasure,</em> it shou'd be faintly, and as turning his Eyes back with Pity; having still his Action and Gesture turn'd the other way towards <em>Virtue.</em> If, on the contrary, he looks on <em>Virtue;</em> it ought to be earnestly, and with extreme attention, having some part of the Action of his Body, inclining still towards <em>Pleasure,</em> and discovering by certain Features of Concern and Pity, intermix'd with the commanding or conquering Passion, that the Decision he is about to make in favour of <em>Virtue,</em> cost him not a little.</p>"

Whatever may be the manner chosen for the designing of this Figure of <b>Hercules</b>, according to that part of the History in which we have taken him; 'tis certain he shou'd be so drawn, as neither by the opening of his mouth, or by any other sign, to leave it in the least dubious whether he is speaking or silent. For 'tis absolutely requisite that <em>Silence</em> shou'd be distinctly characteriz'd in <b>Hercules</b>, not only as the natural effect of his strict Attention, and the little leisure he has from what passes at this time within his breast; but in order withal to give that appearance of Majesty and Superiority becoming the Person and Character of pleading <b>Virtue</b>; who by her Eloquence and other Charms has ere this made her-self mistress of the Heart of our enamour'd Hero:</p>"

Such a Design or Representation as this, wou'd prove contrary to Order, contrary to the History, and to the <em>Decorum,</em> or Decency of Manners. Nor can one well avoid taking notice here, of that general Absurdity committed by many of the esteem'd great Masters in Painting; who in one and the same Company, or Assembly of Persons jointly employ'd, and united according to the History, in one single or common Action, represent to us not only <em>two</em> or <em>three,</em> but <em>several,</em> and sometimes <em>all</em> speaking at once. Which must naturally have the same effect on the Eye, as such a Conversation wou'd have upon the Ear, were we in reality to hear it.</p>"
