A good Poet, and an honest Historian, may afford Learning enough for <em>a Gentleman.</em> And such a one, whilst he reads these Authors as his Diversion, will have a truer relish of their Sense, and understand 'em better than a <em>Pedant,</em> with all his Labours, and the assistance of his Volumes of Commentators. I am sensible, that of old 'twas the custom to send the Youth of highest Quality to <em>Philosophers</em> to be form'd. 'Twas in their Schools, in their Company, and by their Precepts and Example, that the illustrious Pupils were inur'd to Hardship, and exercis'd in the severest Courses of Temperance and Self-denial. By such an early Discipline, they were fitted for the Command of others; to maintain their Country's Honour in War, rule wisely in the State, and fight against Luxury and Corruption in times of Prosperity and Peace. If any of these Arts are comprehended in <em>University-Learning,</em> 'tis well. But as some Universitys in the World are now model'd, they seem not so very effectual to these Purposes, nor so fortunate in preparing for a right Practice of the World, or a just Knowledg of Men and Things. Had you been thorow-pac'd in the <em>Ethicks</em> or <em>Politicks</em> of the Schools, I shou'd never have thought of writing a word to you upon <em>Common Sense,</em> or <em>the Love of Mankind.</em> I shou'd not have cited <a href=\"#n2\">[2]</a>the Poet's <em>Dulce &amp; Decorum.</em> Nor, if I had made a Character for you, as he for his noble Friend, shou'd I have crown'd it with his</p>"

Thus, it seems, we are to learn Virtue by Usury; and inhance the Value of <em>Life,</em> and of the <em>Pleasures of Sense,</em> in order to be wise, and to <em>live well.</em></p>"

You will not be taught to value <em>Life</em> at their rate, or degrade <b>Honesty</b> as they do, who make it only <em>a Name.</em> You are persuaded there is something more in the Thing than <em>Fashion</em> or <em>Applause;</em> that <b>Worth</b> and <b>Merit</b> are substantial, and no way variable by <em>Fancy</em> or <em>Will;</em> and that <b>Honour</b> is as much it-self, when acting <em>by it-self,</em> and <em>unseen,</em> as when <em>seen,</em> and applauded by all the World.</p>"
