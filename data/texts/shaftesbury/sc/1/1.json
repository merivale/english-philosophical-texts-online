Or were you afraid I shou'd not stand the trial, if you put me to it, by making the experiment in <em>my own</em> Case?</p>"

'Tis the Case, I know, with many. Whatever they think grave or solemn, they suppose must never be treated out of a grave and solemn way: Tho what <em>Another</em> thinks so, they can be contented to treat otherwise; and are forward to try the Edge of Ridicule against any Opinions besides <em>their own.</em></p>"

      "content": "<p>The Question is, Whether this be fair or no? and, Whether it be not just and reasonable, to make as free with our <em>own</em> Opinions, as with those of <em>other People?</em> For to be sparing in this case, may be look'd upon as a piece of Selfishness. We may be charg'd perhaps with wilful Ignorance and blind Idolatry, for having taken Opinions upon Trust, and consecrated in our-selves certain <em>Idol-</em>Notions, which we will never suffer to be unveil'd, or seen in open light. They may perhaps be Monsters, and not Divinitys, or Sacred Truths, which are kept thus choicely, in some dark Corner of our Minds: The Specters may impose on us, whilst we refuse to turn 'em every way, and view their Shapes and Complexions in every light. For that which can be shewn only in <em>a certain</em> Light, is questionable. Truth, 'tis suppos'd, may bear <em>all</em> Lights: and <em>one</em> of those principal Lights or natural Mediums, by which Things are to be view'd, in order to a thorow Recognition, is <em>Ridicule</em> it-self, or that Manner of Proof by which we discern whatever is liable to just Raillery in any Subject. So much, at least, is allow'd by All, who at any time appeal to this <em>Criterion.</em> The gravest Gentlemen, even in the gravest Subjects, are suppos'd to acknowledg this: and can have no Right, 'tis thought, to deny others the Freedom of this Appeal; whilst they are free to censure like other Men, and in their gravest Arguments make no scruple to ask, <em>Is it not Ridiculous?</em></p>"

And by this means you will be able to judg of me; whether I was sincere the other day in the Defence of <em>Raillery,</em> and can continue still to plead for those ingenious Friends of ours, who are often censur'd for their Humour of this kind, and for the Freedom they take in such an airy way of Conversation and Writing.</p>"
