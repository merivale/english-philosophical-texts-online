And if possibly it may have that good success, I shou'd have no ordinary opinion of my Project; since I know how hard it wou'd be to give your Lordship a real Entertainment by any thing which was not in some respect worthy and useful.</p>"

I resolv'd afterwards to see what effect it wou'd have, when taken out of mere Black-and-White, into Colours: And thus <em>a Sketch</em> was afterwards drawn. This pleas'd so well, that being incourag'd by the <em>Virtuosi,</em> who are so eminent in this part of the World, I resolv'd at last to engage my Painter in the great Work. Immediately a Cloth was bespoke of a sutable Dimension, and the Figures taken as big or bigger than the common Life; the Subject being of the Heroick kind, and requiring rather such Figures as shou'd appear above ordinary human Stature.</p>"

But the <em>Design</em> having grown thus into <em>a Sketch,</em> and the Sketch afterwards into <em>a Picture;</em> I thought it fit your Lordship shou'd either see the several Pieces together, or be troubled only with that which was the best; as undoubtedly the great one must prove, if the Master I employ sinks not very much below himself, in this Performance.</p>"

I pretend not here to apologize either for <em>them,</em> or for <em>my-self.</em> Your Lordship however knows, I have naturally Ambition enough to make me desirous of employing my-self in Business of a higher Order: since it has been my fortune in publick Affairs to act often in concert with you, and in the same Views, on the Interest of <b>Europe</b> and Mankind. There was a Time, and that a very early one of my Life, when I was not wanting to my Country, in this respect. But after some years of hearty Labour and Pains in this kind of Workmanship, an unhappy Breach in my Health drove me not only from the Seat of Business, but forc'd me to seek these foreign Climates; where, as mild as the <em>Winters</em> generally are, I have with much ado liv'd out this <em>latter-one;</em> and am now, as your Lordship finds, employing my-self in such easy Studys as are most sutable to my state of Health, and to the Genius of the Country where I am confin'd.</p>"

But when the Spirit of the Nation was grown more <em>free,</em> tho engag'd at that time in the fiercest War, and with the most doubtful Success, we no sooner began to turn our-selves towards <em>Musick,</em> and enquire what <b>Italy</b> in particular produc'd, than in an instant we outstrip'd our Neighbours the <b>French</b>, enter'd into a Genius far beyond theirs, and rais'd our-selves an <em>Ear,</em> and <em>Judgment,</em> not inferior to the best now in the World.</p>"

Tho we have as yet nothing of our own native Growth in this kind worthy of being mention'd; yet since the Publick has of late begun to express a Relish for Ingravings, Drawings, Copyings, and for the original Paintings of the chief <em>Italian</em> Schools, (so contrary to the modern <em>French</em>) I doubt not that, in very few years, we shall make an equal progress in this other Science. And when our Humour turns us to cultivate these designing Arts, our Genius, I am persuaded, will naturally carry us over the slighter Amusements, and lead us to that higher, more serious, and noble Part of <em>Imitation,</em> which relates to <em>History, Human Nature,</em> and <em>the chief Degree or Order of</em> <b>Beauty</b>; I mean that of the <em>rational</em> Life, distinct from the merely <em>vegetable</em> and <em>sensible,</em> as in Animals, or Plants; according to those several Degrees or Orders of Painting, which your Lordship will find suggested in this extemporary <em>Notion</em> I have sent you.</p>"

But I question whether our Patience is like to hold much longer. The Devastation so long committed in this kind, has made us begin to grow rude and clamorous at the hearing of a new Palace spoilt, or a new Design committed to some rash or impotent Pretender.</p>"

Nor do I fear that when these new Subjects are attempted, we shou'd miscarry as grosly as we have done in others before. Our <em>State,</em> in this respect, may prove perhaps more fortunate than our <em>Church,</em> in having waited till a national Taste was form'd, before these Edifices were undertaken. But the Zeal of the Nation cou'd not, it seems, admit so long a Delay in their Ecclesiastical Structures, particularly their <em>Metropolitan.</em> And since a Zeal of this sort has been newly kindled amongst us, 'tis like we shall see from afar the many Spires arising in our great City, with such hasty and sudden growth, as may be the occasion perhaps that our immediate Relish shall be hereafter censur'd, as retaining much of what Artists call the <em>Gothick</em> Kind.</p>"

Even those Pieces too are brought under the common Censure, which, tho rais'd by private Men, are of such a Grandure and Magnificence, as to become National Ornaments. The ordinary Man may build his Cottage, or the plain Gentleman his Country-house according as he fansys: but when a great Man builds, he will find little Quarter from the Publick, if instead of a beautiful Pile, he raises, at a vast expence, such a false and counterfeit Piece of Magnificence, as can be justly arraign'd for its Deformity by so many knowing Men in Art, and by the whole <em>People,</em> who, in such a Conjuncture, readily follow their Opinion.</p>"

The Taste of one kind brings necessarily that of the others along with it. When the <em>free</em> Spirit of a Nation turns it-self this way, Judgments are form'd; Criticks arise; the publick Eye and Ear improve; a right Taste prevails, and in a manner forces its way. Nothing is so improving, nothing so natural, so <em>con-genial</em> to the liberal Arts, as that reigning Liberty and high Spirit of a People, which from the Habit of judging in the highest Matters for themselves, makes 'em freely judg of other Subjects, and enter thorowly into the Characters as well of <em>Men</em> and <em>Manners,</em> as of the <em>Products</em> or <em>Works</em> of Men, in Art and Science. So much, my Lord, do we owe to the Excellence of our National Constitution, and Legal Monarchy; happily fitted for Us, and which alone cou'd hold together so mighty a People; all sharers (tho at so far a distance from each other) in the Government of <em>themselves;</em> and meeting under <em>one</em> Head in <em>one</em> vast <em>Metropolis;</em> whose enormous Growth, however censurable in other respects, is actually a Cause that Workmanship and Arts of so many kinds arise to such perfection.</p>"

For shou'd they do so, they wou'd in reality do more harm than good; since 'tis not the Nature of a Court (such as Courts generally are) to improve, but rather corrupt <em>a Taste.</em> And what is in the beginning set wrong by their Example, is hardly ever afterwards recoverable in the Genius of a Nation.</p>"

Nor can one, methinks, with just reason regret her having hitherto made no greater advancement in these affairs of Art. As her <em>Constitution</em> has grown, and been establish'd, she has in proportion fitted her-self for other Improvements. There has been no Anticipation in the Case. And in this surely she must be esteem'd wise, as well as happy; that ere she attempted to raise her-self any other Taste or Relish, she secur'd her-self a right one in <em>Government.</em> She has now the advantage of beginning in other Matters, on a new foot. She has her <em>Models</em> yet to seek, her <em>Scale</em> and <em>Standard</em> to form, with deliberation and good choice. Able enough she is at present to shift for her-self; however abandon'd or helpless she has been left by those whom it became to assist her. Hardly, indeed, cou'd she procure a single <em>Academy</em> for the training of her Youth in Exercises. As good Soldiers as we are, and as good Horses as our Climate affords, our Princes, rather than expend their Treasure this way, have suffer'd our Youth to pass into a foreign Nation, to learn to ride. As for other <em>Academys,</em> such as those for Painting, Sculpture, or Architecture, we have not so much as heard of the Proposal; whilst the Prince of our rival Nation raises Academys, breeds Youth, and sends Rewards and Pensions into foreign Countrys, to advance the Interest and Credit of his own. Now if, notwithstanding the Industry and Pains of this foreign Court, and the supine Un-concernedness of our own, the National Taste however rises, and already shews it-self in many respects beyond that of our so highly-assisted Neighbours; what greater Proof can there be of the Superiority of Genius in one of these Nations above the other?</p>"
