That is majestic and free from commonplace which uses strange words. By <em>strange</em> I mean out-of-the-way words, or metaphorical, or extended in usage; in fact all which are unusual. But if a man compose in such words only, his composition will be either a riddle or gibberish: if he compose in metaphors, a riddle; if in out-of-the-way words, gibberish too.] This the same Master-Critick explains further in his <em>Rhetoricks,</em> Lib. 3. cap. 1. where he refers to these Passages of his <em>Poeticks.</em> Ἐπεὶ δὲ οἱ Ποιηταὶ λέγοντες εὐήθη, διὰ τὴν λέξιν ἐδόκουν πορίσασθαι τήνδε τὴν δόξαν, διὰ του̑το ποιητικὴ πρώτη ἐγένετο λέξις. * * * καὶ νυ̑ν ἔτι οἱ πολλοὶ τω̑ν ἀπαιδεύτων τοὺς τοιούτους οἴονται διαλέγεσθαι κάλλιστα. του̑το δ' οὐκ ἔστιν. * * * οὐδὲ γὰρ οἱ τὰς τραγῳδίας ποιου̑ντες ἔτι χρω̑νται τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον.

[But as the poets, while uttering simple things, were thought to have acquired a reputation through their style, the first (rhetorical) style was poetic in character . . . ; and even now most uneducated men think that speakers of that sort speak best. But this is not so. . . . For not even writers of tragedy use it any longer in the same way, but, just as they changed from tetrameter to iambic metre because the latter is the metre most like prose, so too they have abandoned such terms as are alien to the style of conversation . . . and even the writers of hexameters have abandoned them. So it is absurd to copy men who themselves no longer follow this fashion.] That among the early Reformers of this <em>Bombastick</em> Manner, he places <b>Homer</b> as the Chief, we may see easily in his <em>Poeticks:</em> as particularly in that Passage, cap. 24.

For (with the latter) men are on their guard, suspecting deceit, as they would be against adulterated wines. Your style should be like the voice of Theodorus as compared with that of other actors; for his seemed the very voice of the character, theirs foreign to it. The trick is successfully performed if a man make up his diction by choosing from ordinary conversation. Euripedes does this, and first gave the suggestion.] Rhet. Lib. 3. cap. 2.</p>"

(For some such purpose used Diogenes to borrow these points.) After this, observe what was the Middle Comedy and the New, etc.—Marcus Aurelius, xi. 6.]</p><p>οὔτως δει̑ παρ' ὅλον τὸν βίον ποιει̑ν, καὶ ὅπου λίαν ἀξιοπιστότα τα πράγματα φαντάζηται, ἀπογυμνου̑ν αὐτά, καὶ τὴν εὐτέλειαν αὐτω̑ν καθορα̑ν, καὶ τὴν ἱστορίαν, ὑφ' ᾐ̑ σεμνύνεταί, περιαιρει̑ν. δεινὸς γὰρ ὁ τυ̑φος παραλογιστής. Καὶ ὅτε δοκει̑ς μάλιστα περὶ τὰ σπουδαι̑α καταγίνεσθαι, τότε μάλιστα καταγοητεύει. ὅρα γου̑ν ὁ Κράτης, τί περὶ αὐτου̑ του̑ Ξενοκράτους λέγει. Id. Βιβ. ς. [In this way we must act all through life, and where things seem most worthy of trust we must strip them and see their poorness, and get rid of the claptrap of which they are so proud. For pride is a great deceiver, and when you think you are most occupied with serious things, then it takes you in most. See at all events what Crates says even of Xenocrates.—Mar. Aur. vi. 13.]</p>"

Aristotle too writes thus in his book on <em>Poets:</em> <q>Therefore we must not say that the so-called mimes of Sophron are metrical dialogues or imitations, or the dialogues of Alexamenos of Teos, which were the earliest written of the Socratic dialogues.</q>]</p>"
