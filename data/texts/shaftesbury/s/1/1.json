For in the manner <em>Advice</em> was generally given, there was no reason, I thought, to wonder it shou'd be so ill receiv'd. Something there was which strangely inverted the Case, and made <em>the Giver</em> to be the only Gainer. For by what I cou'd observe in many Occurrences of our Lives, That which we call'd <em>giving Advice,</em> was properly, taking an occasion to shew our own Wisdom, at another's expence. On the other side, to be instructed, or <em>to receive Advice</em> on the terms usually prescrib'd to us, was little better than tamely to afford another the Occasion of raising himself a Character from our Defects.</p>"

In all other respects, <em>to give,</em> and <em>to dispense,</em> is Generosity, and Good-will: but to bestow Wisdom, is to gain a Mastery which can't so easily be allow'd us. Men willingly learn whatever else is taught 'em. They can bear <em>a Master</em> in Mathematicks, in Musick, or in any other Science; but not in <em>Understanding</em> and <em>Good Sense.</em></p>"

For supposing we had Hospitals for this sort of <em>Surgery,</em> and there were always in readiness certain meek <em>Patients</em> who wou'd bear any Incisions, and be prob'd or tented at our pleasure; the advantage no doubt wou'd be considerable in this way of Practice. Some Insight must needs be obtain'd. In time <em>a Hand</em> too might be acquir'd; but in all likelihood <em>a very rough-one:</em> which wou'd by no means serve the purpose of this latter <em>Surgery.</em> For here, <em>a Tenderness of Hand</em> is principally requisite. No Surgeon will be call'd, who has not Feeling and Compassion. And where to find a Subject in which the Operator is likely to preserve the highest <em>Tenderness,</em> and yet act with the greatest <em>Resolution</em> and <em>Boldness,</em> is certainly a matter of no slight Consideration.</p>"

(you'll say:) For who can thus multiply himself into <em>two Persons,</em> and be <em>his own Subject?</em> Who can properly laugh at <em>himself,</em> or find in his heart to be either merry or severe on such an occasion?</q> Go to the <em>Poets,</em> and they will present you with many Instances. Nothing is more common with them, than this sort of <b>Soliloquy.</b> A Person of profound Parts, or perhaps of ordinary Capacity, happens, on some occasion, to commit a Fault. He is concern'd for it. He comes alone upon the Stage; looks about him, to see if any body be near; then takes himself to task, without sparing himself in the least. You wou'd wonder to hear how close he pushes matters, and how thorowly he carrys on the business of <em>Self-dissection.</em> By virtue of this <b>Soliloquy</b> he becomes two distinct <em>Persons.</em> He is Pupil and Preceptor. He teaches, and he learns. And in good earnest, had I nothing else to plead in behalf of the Morals of our modern Dramatick Poets, I shou'd defend 'em still against their Accusers for the sake of this very Practice, which they have taken care to keep up in its full force. For whether the Practice be <em>natural</em> or no, in respect of common Custom and Usage; I take upon me to assert, that it is an honest and laudable Practice; and that if already it be not natural to us, we ought however to make it so, by Study and Application.</p>"

We might peradventure be less noisy and more profitable in Company, if at convenient times we discharg'd some of our articulate Sound, and spoke to ourselves <em>viv√¢ voce</em> when alone.
