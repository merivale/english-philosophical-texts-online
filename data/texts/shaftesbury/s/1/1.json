For in the manner <em>Advice</em> was generally given, there was no reason, I thought, to wonder it shou'd be so ill receiv'd. Something there was which strangely inverted the Case, and made <em>the Giver</em> to be the only Gainer. For by what I cou'd observe in many Occurrences of our Lives, That which we call'd <em>giving Advice,</em> was properly, taking an occasion to shew our own Wisdom, at another's expence. On the other side, to be instructed, or <em>to receive Advice</em> on the terms usually prescrib'd to us, was little better than tamely to afford another the Occasion of raising himself a Character from our Defects.</p>"

In all other respects, <em>to give,</em> and <em>to dispense,</em> is Generosity, and Good-will: but to bestow Wisdom, is to gain a Mastery which can't so easily be allow'd us. Men willingly learn whatever else is taught 'em. They can bear <em>a Master</em> in Mathematicks, in Musick, or in any other Science; but not in <em>Understanding</em> and <em>Good Sense.</em></p>"

For supposing we had Hospitals for this sort of <em>Surgery,</em> and there were always in readiness certain meek <em>Patients</em> who wou'd bear any Incisions, and be prob'd or tented at our pleasure; the advantage no doubt wou'd be considerable in this way of Practice. Some Insight must needs be obtain'd. In time <em>a Hand</em> too might be acquir'd; but in all likelihood <em>a very rough-one:</em> which wou'd by no means serve the purpose of this latter <em>Surgery.</em> For here, <em>a Tenderness of Hand</em> is principally requisite. No Surgeon will be call'd, who has not Feeling and Compassion.

(you'll say:) For who can thus multiply himself into <em>two Persons,</em> and be <em>his own Subject?</em> Who can properly laugh at <em>himself,</em> or find in his heart to be either merry or severe on such an occasion?</q> Go to the <em>Poets,</em> and they will present you with many Instances. Nothing is more common with them, than this sort of <b>Soliloquy.</b> A Person of profound Parts, or perhaps of ordinary Capacity, happens, on some occasion, to commit a Fault. He is concern'd for it. He comes alone upon the Stage; looks about him, to see if any body be near; then takes himself to task, without sparing himself in the least. You wou'd wonder to hear how close he pushes matters, and how thorowly he carrys on the business of <em>Self-dissection.</em> By virtue of this <b>Soliloquy</b> he becomes two distinct <em>Persons.</em> He is Pupil and Preceptor. He teaches, and he learns. And in good earnest, had I nothing else to plead in behalf of the Morals of our modern Dramatick Poets, I shou'd defend 'em still against their Accusers for the sake of this very Practice, which they have taken care to keep up in its full force. For whether the Practice be <em>natural</em> or no, in respect of common Custom and Usage; I take upon me to assert, that it is an honest and laudable Practice; and that if already it be not natural to us, we ought however to make it so, by Study and Application.</p>"

We might peradventure be less noisy and more profitable in Company, if at convenient times we discharg'd some of our articulate Sound, and spoke to ourselves <em>vivâ voce</em> when alone.

In all likelihood they had been once a People remarkably fluent in Expression, much pester'd with Orators and Preachers, and mightily subject to that Disease which has been since call'd <em>the Leprosy of Eloquence;</em> till some sage Legislator arose amongst 'em, who when he cou'd not oppose the Torrent of Words, and stop the Flux of Speech, by any immediate Application, found means to give a vent to the loquacious Humour, and broke the force of the Distemper by eluding it.</p>"
