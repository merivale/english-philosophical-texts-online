For tho compos'd of different Nations, distinct in Laws and Governments, divided by Seas and Continents, dispers'd in distant Islands; yet being originally of the same Extract, united by one single Language, and animated by that social, publick and <em>free</em> Spirit, which notwithstanding the Animosity of their several warring States, induc'd them to erect such heroick Congresses and Powers as those which constituted the <b>Amphictonian</b> <em>Councils,</em> the <b>Olympick,Isthmian,</b> and other <em>Games;</em> they cou'd not but naturally polish and refine each other. 'Twas thus they brought their beautiful and comprehensive Language to a just <em>Standard,</em> leaving only such Variety in the Dialects as render'd their Poetry, in particular, so much the more agreeable. The <em>Standard</em> was in the same proportion carry'd into other <em>Arts.</em> The <em>Secretion</em> was made. The several <em>Species</em> found, and set apart. The Performers and Masters in every kind, honour'd and admir'd. And, last of all, even <b>Criticks</b> themselves acknowledg'd and receiv'd as <em>Masters</em> over all the rest. From <em>Musick, Poetry, Rhetorick,</em> down to the simple Prose of <em>History,</em> thro' all the plastick Arts of <em>Sculpture, Statuary, Painting, Architecture,</em> and the rest; every thing <em>Muse-like,</em> graceful and exquisite, was rewarded with the highest Honours, and carry'd on with the utmost Ardor and Emulation. Thus <b>Greece,</b> tho she <em>exported</em> Arts to other Nations, had properly for her own share no <em>Import</em> of the kind. The utmost which cou'd be nam'd, wou'd amount to no more than raw <em>Materials,</em> of a rude and barbarous form. And thus the Nation was evidently <em>Original</em> in Art; and with them every noble Study and Science was (as the great Master, so often cited by our Author, says of certain kinds of Poetry)<a href=\"#n5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> <em>self-form'd,</em> wrought out of Nature, and drawn from the necessary Operation and Course of things, working, as it were, of their own accord, and proper inclination. Now according to this <em>natural</em> Growth of Arts, peculiar to <b>Greece,</b> it wou'd necessarily happen; That at the beginning, when the Force of Language came to be first prov'd; when the admiring World made their first <em>Judgment,</em> and essay'd their <em>Taste</em> in the Elegancys of this sort; the <em>Lofty,</em> the <em>Sublime,</em> the <em>Astonishing</em> and <em>Amazing</em> wou'd be the most in fashion, and prefer'd. <em>Metaphorical</em> Speech, Multiplicity of <em>Figures</em> and <em>high</em>-sounding Words wou'd naturally prevail. Tho in the Common-wealth it-self, and in the Affairs of Government, Men were us'd originally to plain and direct Speech; yet when Speaking became <em>an Art,</em> and was taught by Sophists, and other pretended Masters, the <em>high-poetick,</em> and the <em>figurative</em> Way began to prevail, even at the Bar, and in the Publick Assemblys: Insomuch that the Grand-Master, in the<a href=\"#n6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> above-cited part of his <em>Rhetoricks,</em> where he extols the Tragick Poet <b>Euripides,</b> upbraids the Rhetoricians of his own Age, who retain'd that very bombastick Style, which even <em>Poets,</em> and those too of the tragick kind, had already thrown off, or at least considerably mitigated. But the <em>Taste</em> of <b>Greece</b> was now polishing. A better Judgment was soon form'd, when a <b>Demosthenes</b> was heard, and had found success. The People themselves (as our Author has shewn) came now to reform their <b>Comedy,</b> and familiar Manner, after <b>Tragedy,</b> and the higher Style, had been brought to its perfection under the last hand of an <b>Euripides.</b> And now in all the principal Works of <em>Ingenuity</em> and <em>Art,</em> <b>Simplicity</b> and <b>Nature</b> began chiefly to be sought: And this was the <b>Taste</b> which lasted thro' so many Ages, till the Ruin of all things, under a Universal Monarchy.</p>"
