That they were really so design'd, the <em>Advertisement</em> to the first Edition of his <em>Soliloquy</em> is a sufficient Proof. He took occasion there, in a line or two, under the Name of his <em>Printer,</em> or (as he otherwise calls him) his <em>Amanuensis,</em> to prepare us for <em>a more elaborate</em> and methodical Piece which was to follow. We have this System now before us. Nor need we wonder, such as it is, that it came so hardly into the World, and that our Author has been deliver'd of it with so much difficulty, and after so long a time.

[You must do away with desire altogether, and transfer aversion to those things only which are within the scope of the will.] Arrian. Lib. iii. cap. 22. This subdu'd or moderated <em>Admiration</em> or <em>Zeal</em> in the highest Subjects of <em>Virtue</em> and <em>Divinity,</em> the Philosopher calls σύμμετρον καὶ καθισταμένην τὴν ὄρεξιν [Desire settled and proportioned to its objects.]; the contrary Disposition, τὸ ἄλογον καὶ ὠστικόν. [Unreasonable and pushing.] Lib. ii. cap. 26. The Reason why this over-forward Ardor and Pursuit of high Subjects runs naturally into Enthusiasm and Disorder, is shewn in what succeeds the first of the Passages here cited; <em>viz.</em> τω̑ν δὲ ἐφ ἡμι̑ν, ὅσαν ὀρέγεσθαι καλὸν ἄν, οὐδὲν οὐδέτω σοι πάρεστι. [And of things in our power, such as it would be well to desire, no one is yet set before you.] And hence the repeated Injunction, ἀπόσχου ποτὲ παντάποσιν ὀρέξεως, ἵνα ποτὲ καὶ εὐλόγως ὀρεχθη̑ςῃ εἰ δ' εὐλόγως, ὅταν ἔχῃς τί ἐν σεαυτῳ̑ ἀγαθὸν εὐ̑ ὀρεχθήση. [Keep away altogether from desire, in order that you may some day have a desire with good reason; and if with good reason, when you have anything good in you, you will desire well.] Lib. iii. cap. 13.

Nor was this Prohibition of the <em>wondering</em> or <em>admiring</em> Habit, in early Students, peculiar to <em>one</em> kind of Philosophy alone. It was common to many; however the Reason and Account of it might differ, in one Sect from the other. The <b>Pythagoreans</b> sufficiently check'd their <b>Tyro'</b> s, by silencing them so long on their first Courtship to <em>Philosophy.</em> And tho <em>Admiration,</em> in the Peripatetick Sense, as above-mention'd, may be justly call'd the inclining Principle or first Motive to PHILOSOPHY; yet this Mistress, when once espous'd, teaches us <em>to admire,</em> after a different manner from what we did before.
