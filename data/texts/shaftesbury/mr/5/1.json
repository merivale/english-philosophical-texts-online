His own Words in a Letter to one of the <em>French</em> Bishops, a Man of the highest Consideration and Merit, (as a noted modern <em>Critick,</em> and satirical Genius of that Nation acknowledges) are as follow. <em>Pervenit ad nos quod sine verecundiâ memorare non possumus, fraternitatem tuam GRAMMATICAM quibusdam exponere.

Paris. Ann. 1533. And in his Dedication, or first Preface to his Morals, after some very insipid <em>Rhetorick,</em> and <em>figurative</em> Dialect imploy'd against the <em>Study</em> and <em>Art</em> of <em>Speech,</em> he has another Fling at the Classick Authors and Discipline; betraying his inveterate Hatred to antient Learning, as well as the natural Effect of this <em>Zealot-Passion,</em> in his own Barbarity both of Style and Manners. His words are, <em>Unde &amp; ipsam artem loquendi, quam Magisteria Disciplinae exterioris insinuant, servare despexi. Nam sicut hujus quoque Epistolae tenor enunciat, non Metacismi collisionem fugio: non Barbarismi confusionem devito, situs motusque praepositionum casusque servare contemno: quia indignum vehementer existimo, ut verba coelestis oraculi restringam sub regulis</em> <b>Donati.</b> [So I think scorn of observing even the art of speech, which the wider education is bringing in upon us. For, as the course of this letter shows, I do not avoid the frequent use of M; I do not shun barbarisms; I despise rules about the position or the changing or the cases of prepositions: for I strongly hold it to be unfitting to bind the words of heaven by the rules of Donatus.] That he carry'd this savage Zeal of his so far as to destroy (what in him lay) the whole Body of <em>Learning,</em> with all the <em>Classick Authors</em> then in being, was generally believ'd. And (what was yet more notorious and unnatural in a <b>Roman</b> <em>Pontiff</em>) the Destruction of the <em>Statues, Sculptures,</em> and finest Pieces of Antiquity in <b>Rome,</b> was charg'd on him by his Successor in the <em>SEE;</em> as, besides <b>Platina,</b> another Writer of his Life, without the least Apology, confesses. See in the above-cited Edition of St. <b>Gregory'</b> s Works, at the beginning, <em>viz. Vita D. Gregorii ex Joan. Laxiardo Coelestino.</em> 'Tis no wonder, therefore, if other Writers have given account of that Sally of the Prelate's Zeal against the <em>Books</em> and <em>Learning</em> of the <em>Antients,</em> for which the Reason alledg'd was very extraordinary; <q>That the holy Scriptures wou'd be the better relish'd, and receive a considerable Advantage by the Destruction of these Rivals.</q> It seems they had no very high Idea of <em>the holy Scriptures,</em> when they suppos'd them such Losers by <em>a Comparison.</em> However, 'twas thought advisable by other <em>Fathers</em> (who had a like view) to frame new Pieces of Literature, after the Model of these condemn'd Antients. Hence those ridiculous Attempts of new <em>heroick Poems,</em> new <em>Epicks</em> and <em>Dramaticks,</em> new <b>Homers,Euripides'</b> s, <b>Menanders,</b> which were with so much Pains and so little Effect industriously set afoot by the zealous Priesthood; when Ignorance prevail'd, and the Hierarchal Dominion was so universal. But tho their Power had well nigh compass'd the Destruction of those <em>great Originals,</em> they were far from being able to procure any Reception for their <em>puny Imitations.</em> The <em>Mock-Works</em> have lain in their deserv'd Obscurity; as will all other Attempts of that kind, concerning which our Author has already given his Opinion, VOL. I. <em>pag.</em> 356, 357, &amp;c. But as to the <em>ill Policy</em> as well as <em>Barbarity</em> of this <em>Zealot</em>-Enmity against the Works of the Antients, a foreign Protestant Divine, and most learned Defender of Religion, making the best Excuse he can for the <b>Greek</b> -<em>Fathers,</em> and endeavouring to clear them from this general Charge of Havock and Massacre committed upon <em>Science</em> and <em>Erudition,</em> has these words: <q><em>Si cela est, voilà encore un nouveau Sujet de mépriser les Patriarches de</em> <b>Constantinople</b> <em>qui n'étoient d'ailleurs rien moins que gens de bien; mais j'ai de la poine à le croire, parce qu'il nous est resté de Poetes infiniment plus sales que ceux qui se sont perdus.

Il peuvoit être neanmoins arrivé, que quelques</em> <b>Ecclesiastiques</b> <em>ennemis des</em> Belles Lettres, <em>en eussent usé comme dit</em> <b>Chalcondyle,</b> <em>sans penser qu'en conservant</em> toute l'Antiquité Grecque, <em>ils conserveroient la Langue de leurs Prédecesseurs, &amp; une infinité de Faits qui servoient beaucoup à l'intelligence &amp; à la confirmation de</em> l'Histoire Sacrée, <em>&amp; même</em> de la Religion Chretienne. <em>Ces gens-là devoient au moins nous conserver les Histoires Anciennes des Orientaux, comme des</em> Chaldéens, <em>des</em> Tyriens, <em>&amp; des</em> Egyptiens; <em>mais ils agissoient plus par ignorance &amp; par negligence, que par raison.</em></q> [If that is (true), behold yet again a new reason to disdain the Patriarchs of Constantinople, who moreover were nothing less than good men; but I have difficulty believing it, because there has survived to us Poets infinitely more bawdy than those who were lost. No one doubts that Aristophanes was not much more dirty than Menander. Plutarch testifies well to this in the comparison he made of the two Poets. It could have happened nonetheless that certain Clerics, foes to Belles-Lettres, could have used them as Chalcondyle says, without thinking that by conserving all of Greek Antiquity they would conserve the language of their Predecessors, and an infinity of facts that would aid greatly in the understanding and confirmation of Sacred History and even of the Christian Religion. Those men at least ought to conserve for us the Ancient Histories of the Orientals, such as the Chaldeans, the Tyrians, and the Egyptians, but they acted more from ignorance and negligence than by reason.] BIBL.

Among the Christians who were candidates for baptism, to these with the living voice, the mysteries were being handed down to the Christian believers without written instructions, a practice which Paul and Luke called to instruct. Thus those who were being taught were called the catechumen; those who were teaching, the catechists.]</p>"

I. <em>pag.</em> 346. His LYES, according to that Master's Opinion, and the Judgment of many of the gravest and most venerable Writers, were, in themselves, the justest <em>Moral Truths,</em> and exhibitive of the best Doctrine and Instruction in Life and Manners. It may be ask'd perhaps, <q>How comes the Poet, then, to draw no single Pattern of the kind, no <em>perfect Character,</em> in either of his Heroick Pieces?</q> I answer, that shou'd he attempt to do it, he wou'd, <em>as a Poet,</em> be preposterous and false. 'Tis not <em>the Possible,</em> but <em>the Probable</em> and <em>Likely,</em> which must be the Poet's Guide in <em>Manners.</em> By this he wins Attention, and moves the conscious Reader or Spectator; who judges best from <em>within,</em> by what he naturally feels and experiences in his own Heart. The Perfection of Virtue is from long <em>Art</em> and <em>Management, Self-controul,</em> and, as it were, <em>Force on Nature.</em> But the common Auditor or Spectator, who seeks Pleasure only, and loves to engage his Passion, by view of other Passion and Emotion, comprehends little of the Restraints, Allays and Corrections, which form this <em>new</em> and <em>artificial Creature.</em> For such indeed is the <em>truly virtuous Man;</em> whose ART, tho ever so <em>natural</em> in it-self, or justly founded in <em>Reason</em> and <em>Nature,</em> is an Improvement far beyond the common Stamp, or known Character of Human Kind. And thus the compleatly virtuous and perfect Character is <em>unpoetical</em> and <em>false.</em> Effects must not appear, where Causes must necessarily remain unknown and incomprehensible. A HERO <em>without Passion,</em> is, in Poetry, as absurd as <em>a</em> HERO <em>without Life or Action.</em> Now if <em>Passion</em> be allow'd, <em>passionate Action</em> must ensue. The same Heroick Genius and seeming Magnanimity which transport us when beheld, are naturally transporting in the Lives and Manners of <em>the Great,</em> who are describ'd to us. And thus the able <em>Designer,</em> who feigns in behalf of <em>Truth,</em> and draws his Characters after the <em>Moral Rule,</em> fails not to discover Nature's Propensity; and assigns to these high Spirits their proper Exorbitancy, and Inclination to exceed in that Tone or Species of Passion, which constitutes the eminent or shining part of each poetical Character. The Passion of an <b>Achilles</b> is towards that Glory which is acquir'd by Arms and personal Valour. In favour of this Character, we forgive the generous Youth his Excess of Ardor in the Field, and his Resentment when injur'd and provok'd in Council, and by his Allies. The Passion of an <b>Ulysses</b> is towards that Glory which is acquir'd by Prudence, Wisdom, and Ability in Affairs. 'Tis in favour of this Character that we forgive him his subtle, crafty, and deceitful Air: since the <em>intriguing Spirit,</em> the <em>over-reaching Manner,</em> and <em>Over-refinement of Art and Policy,</em> are as naturally incident to the experienc'd and thorow Politician, as <em>sudden Resentment, indiscreet and rash Behaviour,</em> to the open undesigning Character of a warlike Youth. The gigantick Force and military Toil of an <b>Ajax</b> wou'd not be so easily credible, or engaging, but for the honest Simplicity of his Nature, and the Heaviness of his Parts and Genius. For Strength of Body being so often noted by us, as un-attended with equal Parts and Strength of Mind; when we see this natural Effect express'd, and find our secret and malicious kind of Reasoning confirm'd, on this hand; we yield to any <em>Hyperbole</em> of our Poet, on the other. He has afterwards his full Scope, and Liberty of enlarging, and exceeding, in the peculiar Virtue and Excellence of his Hero. He may <em>lye</em> splendidly, raise <em>wonder,</em> and be as <em>astonishing</em> as he pleases. Every thing will be allow'd him in return for this frank Allowance. Thus the Tongue of a <b>Nestor</b> may work Prodigys, whilst the accompanying Allays of a rhetorical Fluency, and aged Experience, are kept in view. An <b>Agamemnon</b> may be admir'd as a noble and wise Chief, whilst a certain princely Haughtiness, a Stiffness, and stately Carriage natural to the Character, are represented in his Person, and noted in their ill Effects. For thus <em>the Excesses</em> of every Character are by the Poet <em>redress'd.</em> And the Misfortunes naturally attending such Excesses, being justly apply'd; our Passions, whilst in the strongest manner engag'd and mov'd, are in the wholesomest and most effectual manner corrected and <em>purg'd.</em> Were a Man to form himself by one single Pattern or Original, however perfect; he wou'd himself be a mere <em>Copy.</em> But whilst he draws from various Models, he is <em>original, natural,</em> and <em>unaffected.</em> We see in outward Carriage and Behaviour, how ridiculous any one becomes who imitates another, be he ever so graceful. They are mean Spirits who love to copy <em>merely.</em> Nothing is agreeable or natural, but what is <em>original.</em> Our Manners, like our Faces, tho ever so beautiful, must differ in their Beauty. An Over-regularity is next to a Deformity. And in <em>a Poem,</em> whether <em>Epick</em> or <em>Dramatick,</em> a compleat and <em>perfect Character</em> is the greatest <em>Monster;</em> and of all poetick Fictions not only the least <em>engaging,</em> but the least <em>moral</em> and <em>improving.</em>—Thus much by way of Remark upon <em>poetical TRUTH,</em> and the just Fiction, or artful <em>Lying</em> of the able Poet; according to the Judgment of the <em>Master</em>-Critick. What <b>Horace</b> expresses of the same <em>Lying</em> Virtue, is of an easier sense, and needs no explanation.</p><ul><em>Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet;</em> <br><em>Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.</em> <br><li id=\"Shaftesbury_5989_1111\"><div class=\"closer\">\n<div class=\"bibl\">De Arte Poet. ver. 152.</div>\n</div></li></ul><p>[Such is his use of fiction, such his combination of true and false, that the middle does not clash with the beginning or the end with the middle.]</p><p>The same may be observ'd not only in <em>Heroick</em> Draughts, but in the inferior Characters of <em>Comedy.</em></p><ul><em>Quàm similis uterque est sui!</em><li class=\"indent-yes\" id=\"Shaftesbury_5989_1113\">Ter.

[And perhaps Nature wants opposites too, and wants to make harmony out of them, not out of similars; as, for instance, she brings the male to the female and not each of these to one of his or her own sex; and she made the first concord by means of opposites, not similars. Art too seems to do this in imitation of nature. For painting, by combining the natures of black and white, yellow and red, makes its representations correspond with their types. Music, uniting sharp and grave notes, and long and short syllables, makes one harmony among different sounds. Grammar too, bringing together vowels and consonants, builds her whole art upon them. This is the very point which was given forth by Heraclitus the Obscure, who said, <q>combine wholes and parts, that which is dispersed and that which is united, that which makes discord and that which is in unison, and out of all comes one and out of one comes all.</q> . . . There is one harmony arising from all the bodies which sound together and circle in the sky, and it springs from one thing and ends in one. We might with correct etymology call the universe an order, but not a disorder. And, just as in a chorus, when the leader has led off, all the band of men (and sometimes women) joins in, making by combination of different voices, higher and lower, one harmony in unison, so it is also in the case of the Deity who controls the universe.] See VOL.
