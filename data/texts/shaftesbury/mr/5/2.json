Allow your Adversary his full Reason, his Ingenuity, Sense, and Art. Trust to the <em>chief Character</em> or <b>Hero</b> <em>of your Piece.</em> Make him as dazling <em>bright,</em> as you are able. He will undoubtedly overcome the utmost Force of his Opponent, and dispel the Darkness or Cloud, which the Adversary may unluckily have rais'd.

How wittily soever your Comedy may be wrought up, they will scarce apprehend any of that Wit to fall upon themselves. They may laugh indeed at the Diversion you are pleas'd to give 'em: But <em>the Laugh</em> perhaps may be different from what you intend. They may smile secretly to see themselves thus encounter'd; when they find, at last, your Authority laid by, and your <em>scholastick</em> Weapons quitted, in favour of this weak Attempt, <em>To master them by their own Arms, and proper Ability.</em></q></p>"

If I have not reason to prefer his single Judgment to a whole Faction, let the World be judge: For the Opposition is the same with that of <b>Lucan'</b> s Hero against an Army, <em>concurrere Bellum atque Virum</em> [they run together the war and the man.] I think I may modestly conclude, <em>&amp;c.</em></q></p><p>Thus he goes on, to the very end, in the self-same Strain.

'Tis <em>a Sceptick</em> recites: and the Hero of the Piece passes for <em>an Enthusiast.</em> If a perfect Character be wanting; 'tis the same Case here, as with the Poets in some of their best Pieces.

But whatever our Author may have affected in his <em>Title-Page,</em> 'twas so little his Intention to write after that Model of incoherent Workmanship, that it appears to be sorely against his Will, if this <em>Dialogue-Piece</em> of his has not the just Character, and correct Form of those antient <em>Poems</em> describ'd. He wou'd gladly have constituted ONE single <em>Action</em> and <em>Time,</em> sutable to the just Simplicity of those Dramatick Works.
