Nothing can be more complex or multiform than their moral <em>Draughts</em> or <em>Sketches</em> of Humanity. These, indeed, are so far from representing any <em>particular</em> <b>Man,</b> or <em>Order of</em> <b>Men,</b> that they scarce resemble any thing of <em>the Kind.</em> 'Tis by their Names only that these <em>Characters</em> are figur'd. Tho they bear different Titles, and are set up to maintain contrary Points; they are found, at the bottom, to be all of the same side; and, notwithstanding their seeming Variance, to co-operate in the most officious manner with the Author, towards the display of his own proper Wit, and the establishment of his private Opinion and Maxims. They are indeed his very legitimate and obsequious <em>Puppets;</em> as like <em>real Men</em> in Voice, Action, and Manners, as those wooden or wire Engines of the lower Stage. <b>Philotheus</b> and <b>Philatheus,Philautus</b> and <b>Philalethes</b> are of one and the same Order: Just Tallys to one another: Questioning and Answering in concert, and with such a sort of Alternative as is known in a vulgar Play, where <em>one</em> Person lies down blindfold, and presents himself, as fair as may be, to <em>another,</em> who by favour of the Company, or the assistance of his Good-fortune, deals his Companion many a sound Blow, without being once challeng'd, or brought into his Turn of <em>lying down.</em></p>"

Be not so cautious of furnishing your <em>representative</em> <b>Sceptick</b> with too good <em>Arguments,</em> or too shreud a Turn of <em>Wit</em> or <em>Humour.</em> Be no so fearful of giving quarter. Allow your Adversary his full Reason, his Ingenuity, Sense, and Art. Trust to the <em>chief Character</em> or <b>Hero</b> <em>of your Piece.</em> Make him as dazling <em>bright,</em> as you are able. He will undoubtedly overcome the utmost Force of his Opponent, and dispel the Darkness or Cloud, which the Adversary may unluckily have rais'd. But if when you have fairly wrought up your <em>Antagonist</em> to his due Strength and cognizable Proportion, your <em>chief Character</em> cannot afterwards prove a match for him, or shine with a superior Brightness; Whose Fault is it?—The <em>Subject's?</em>—This, I hope, you will never allow.—Whose, therefore, beside <em>your own?</em>—Beware then; and consider well your Strength and Mastership in this manner of Writing, and in the qualifying Practice of the polite World, ere you attempt these accurate and refin'd Limnings or Portraitures of Mankind, or offer to bring <em>Gentlemen</em> on the Stage. For if <em>real Gentlemen,</em> seduc'd, as you pretend, and made erroneous in their Religion or Philosophy, discover not the least Feature of their real Faces in your Looking-glass, nor know themselves, in the least, by your Description; they will hardly be apt to think they are refuted. How wittily soever your Comedy may be wrought up, they will scarce apprehend any of that Wit to fall upon themselves. They may laugh indeed at the Diversion you are pleas'd to give 'em: But <em>the Laugh</em> perhaps may be different from what you intend. They may smile secretly to see themselves thus encounter'd; when they find, at last, your Authority laid by, and your <em>scholastick</em> Weapons quitted, in favour of this weak Attempt, <em>To master them by their own Arms, and proper Ability.</em></q></p>"

Let the common receiv'd Opinion, and <em>Ausonius</em>'s famous Epigram answer that. Lastly, a more ignorant sort of Creatures than either of the former, maintain that the Character of <b>Dorax</b> is not only unnatural, but inconsistent with it-self. Let them read the Play, and think again.—A longer Reply is what those Cavillers deserve not. But I will give them and their Fellows to understand, that the Earl of * * * was pleas'd to read the Tragedy twice over before it was acted, and did me the favour to send me word, that I had written beyond any of my former Plays, and that he was displeas'd any thing shou'd be cut away. If I have not reason to prefer his single Judgment to a whole Faction, let the World be judge: For the Opposition is the same with that of <b>Lucan'</b> s Hero against an Army, <em>concurrere Bellum atque Virum</em> [they run together the war and the man.] I think I may modestly conclude, <em>&amp;c.</em></q></p><p>Thus he goes on, to the very end, in the self-same Strain.

'Tis <em>a Sceptick</em> recites: and the Hero of the Piece passes for <em>an Enthusiast.</em> If a perfect Character be wanting; 'tis the same Case here, as with the Poets in some of their best Pieces. And this surely is a sufficient Warrant for the Author of a PHILOSOPHICAL ROMANCE.</q>—Thus our Author himself; who to conceal, however, his strict Imitation of the antient <em>poetick</em> DIALOGUE, has prefix'd an auxiliary Title to his Work, and given it the Sirname of RHAPSODY: As if it were merely of that <em>Essay</em> or <em>mix'd</em> kind of Works, which come abroad with an affected Air of Negligence and Irregularity. But whatever our Author may have affected in his <em>Title-Page,</em> 'twas so little his Intention to write after that Model of incoherent Workmanship, that it appears to be sorely against his Will, if this <em>Dialogue-Piece</em> of his has not the just Character, and correct Form of those antient <em>Poems</em> describ'd. He wou'd gladly have constituted ONE single <em>Action</em> and <em>Time,</em> sutable to the just Simplicity of those Dramatick Works.
