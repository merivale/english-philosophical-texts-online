There are, besides, so many thousands of <em>Copys</em> that were writ by Persons of several <em>Interests</em> and <em>Persuasions,</em> such different Understandings and Tempers, such distinct Abilitys and Weaknesses, that 'tis no wonder there is so great <em>variety of Readings:</em>—whole Verses in <em>one,</em> that are not in <em>another:</em>—whole Books admitted by <em>one</em> Church or Communion, which are rejected by <em>another:</em> and whole Storys and Relations admitted by <em>some</em> Fathers, and rejected by <em>others.</em>—I consider withal, that there have been many <em>Designs</em> and <em>Views</em> in expounding these Writings; many <em>Senses</em> in which they are expounded: and when the <em>Grammatical Sense</em> is found out, we are many times never the nearer. Now there being such variety of <em>Senses</em> in Scripture, and but few Places so mark'd out, as not to be capable of more than one; if Men will write Commentarys <em>by Fancy,</em> what infallible <em>Criterion</em> will be left to judg of the <em>certain Sense</em> of such Places as have been the matter of Question? I consider again, that there are indeed divers Places in these sacred Volumes containing in them Mysterys and Questions of great Concernment; yet such is the Fabrick and Constitution of the Whole, that there is no certain Mark to determine whether the Sense of these Passages shou'd be taken as <em>literal</em> or <em>figurative.</em> There is nothing in the nature of the thing to determine <em>the Sense</em> or <em>Meaning:</em> but it must be gotten out as it can.

The Pages answering to the Places above-cited are 401, 402, (and in the Epistle-Dedicatory, three or four Leaves before) 438, 439–444, 451, 452. After which, in the succeeding Page, he sums up his Sense on this Subject of sacred Literature, and the Liberty of Criticism, and of private Judgment and Opinion in these Matters, in the following words: <q>Since there are so many Copys, with infinite Varietys of Reading; since a various Interpunction, a Parenthesis, a Letter, an Accent may much alter the Sense; since some Places have divers literal Senses, many have spiritual, mystical, and allegorical Meanings; since there are so many Tropes, Metonymys, Ironys, Hyperboles, Proprietys and Improprietys of Language, whose understanding depends upon such Circumstances, that it is almost impossible to know the proper Interpretation, now that the knowledg of such Circumstances and particular Storys is irrecoverably lost: since there are some Mysterys, which at the best Advantage of Expression, are not easy to be apprehended, and whose Explication, by reason of our Imperfections, must needs be dark, sometimes weak, sometimes unintelligible: And lastly, since those ordinary means of expounding Scripture, as searching the Originals, Conference of Places, Parity of Reason, and Analogy of Faith, are all dubious, uncertain, and very fallible; he that is the wisest, and by consequence the likeliest to expound truest, in all probability of Reason, will be very far from Confidence; because every one of these, and many more, are like so many degrees of Improbability and Incertainty, all depressing our Certainty of finding out Truth, in such Mysterys, and amidst so many Difficultys. And therefore a wise Man that considers this, wou'd not willingly be prescrib'd to by others; for it is best every Man shou'd be left in that liberty, from which no Man can justly take him, unless he cou'd secure him from Error.</q> The Reverend Prelate had but a few Pages before (<em>viz. pag.</em> 427.) acknowledg'd, indeed, <q>That we had an Apostolical Warrant to <em>contend earnestly for the Faith.</em></q> But then, (says the good Bishop, very candidly and ingenuously) <q>As these Things recede farther from the Foundation, our Certainty is the less.—And therefore it were very fit that our <em>Confidence</em> shou'd be according to our <em>Evidence,</em> and our <em>Zeal</em> according to our <em>Confidence.</em></q> He adds, <em>pag.</em> 507. <q>All these Disputes concerning Tradition, Councils, Fathers, <em>&amp;c.</em> are not Arguments against or besides Reason, but Contestations and Pretenses of the best Arguments, and the most certain Satisfaction of our Reason. But then all these coming into question, submit themselves to Reason, that is, to be judg'd by human Understanding, upon the best Grounds and Information it can receive. So that Scripture, Tradition, Councils, and Fathers, are the Evidence in a Question, but Reason is the Judg: That is, we being the Persons that are to be persuaded, we must see that we be persuaded reasonably; and it is unreasonable to assent to a lesser Evidence, when a greater and clearer is propounded: but of that every Man for himself is to take cognizance, if he be able to judg; if he be not, he is not bound under the tie of necessity to know any thing of it.</q></p>"

And accordingly it may be understood, of what effect the <em>dogmatizing</em> Practice in Divinity has ever been. <q>We will suppose then, that about the time, when universal <em>Ignorance,</em> and the genuine Daughter of it, (call her <em>Devotion</em> or <em>Superstition</em>) had over-spread the World, and the generality of People were strongly inclin'd to believe <em>strange things;</em> and even the greatest Contradictions were recommended to them under the notion of MYSTERYS, being told by their <em>Priests</em> and <em>Guides,</em> That the more contradictious any thing is to Reason, the greater merit there is in believing it: I say, let us suppose, that in this state of things, one or more of the most Eminent then in the Church, either out of Design, or out of superstitious Ignorance and Mistake of the Sense of our Saviour's Words used in the Consecration of the Sacrament, shou'd advance this new Doctrine, that the words of Consecration, <em>&amp;c.</em> * * * Such a Doctrine as this was very likely to be advanc'd by the ambitious <em>Clergy</em> of that time, as a probable means to draw in the People to a greater Veneration of them. * * * Nor was such a Doctrine less likely to take and prevail among the <em>People,</em> in an Age prodigiously ignorant and strongly inclin'd to Superstition, and thereby well-prepar'd to receive the grossest Absurdities under the notion of <em>Mysterys.</em> * * * Now supposing such a Doctrine as this, so fitted to the Humour and Temper of the Age, to be once asserted either by chance or out of design, it wou'd take like <em>Wild-fire;</em> especially if by some one or more who bore sway in the Church, it were but recommended with <em>convenient Gravity and Solemnity.</em> * * * * And for the Contradictions contain'd in this Doctrine, it was but telling the People <em>then,</em> (as they do in effect <em>now</em>) That Contradictions ought to be no Scruple in the way of Faith; That the more impossible any thing is, 'tis the fitter to be believ'd; That it is not praise-worthy to believe plain Possibilitys, but this is the Gallantry and heroical Power of Faith, this is the way to oblige God Almighty for ever to us, to believe flat and downright Contradictions. * * * The more absurd and unreasonable any thing is, it is for that very reason the more proper matter for an Article of Faith. And if any of these Innovations be objected against, as contrary to former Belief and Practice, it is but putting forth a lusty Act of Faith, and believing another Contradiction, That tho they be contrary, yet they are the same.</q> Above, <em>pag.</em> 80, 1, 2.</p>"
