But as to all <em>Prefatory</em> or <em>Dedicatory</em> Discourse, he has told us his Mind sufficiently, in that Treatise which he calls <b>Soliloquy</b>. Being satisfy'd however, that there are many Persons who esteem these <em>Introductory Pieces</em> as very essential in the Constitution of a Work; he has thought fit, in behalf of his honest <em>Printer</em>, to substitute these Lines under the Title of <b>a Preface</b>; and to declare, <q>That (according to his best Judgment and Authority) these Presents ought to pass, and be receiv'd, constru'd, and taken, as satisfactory in full, for all Preliminary Composition, Dedication, direct or indirect Application for Favour to the Publick, or to any private Patron, or Party whatsoever: Nothing to the contrary appearing to him, from the side of <em>Truth</em>, or <em>Reason</em>. Witness his Hand, this Fifth Day of <em>December</em>, <em>1710</em>.</q></em></p>"
