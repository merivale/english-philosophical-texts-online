For to instance in what we see before us; I know you look upon the <em>Trees</em> of this vast Wood to be different from one another: And this tall <em>Oak,</em> the noblest of the Company, as it is by it-self a different thing from all its Fellows of the Wood, so with its own Wood of numerous spreading Branches (which seem <em>so many different</em> <b>Trees</b> ) 'tis still, I suppose, one and <em>the</em> <em>self-same</em> <b>Tree.</b> Now shou'd you, as a mere Caviller, and not as a fair <em>Sceptick,</em> tell me that if a Figure of Wax, or any other Matter, were cast in the exact Shape and Colours of this Tree, and temper'd, if possible, to the same kind of Substance, it might therefore possibly be <em>a real Tree</em> of the same Kind or Species; I wou'd have done with you, and reason no longer. But if you question'd me fairly, and desir'd I shou'd satisfy you what I thought it was which made this <em>Oneness</em> or <em>Sameness</em> in the Tree or any other Plant; or by what it differ'd from the waxen Figure, or from any such Figure accidentally made, either in the Clouds, or on the Sand by the Sea-shore; I shou'd tell you, that neither the <em>Wax,</em> nor <em>Sand,</em> nor <em>Cloud</em> thus piec'd together by our Hand or Fancy, had any real relation within themselves, or had any Nature by which they corresponded any more in that near Situation of Parts, than if scatter'd ever so far asunder. But this I shou'd affirm, ‘That wherever there was such a <em>Sympathizing of Parts,</em> as we saw here, in our <em>real</em> <b>Tree;</b> Wherever there was such a plain Concurrence <em>in one common End,</em> and to the Support, Nourishment, and Propagation of so fair <em>a Form;</em> we cou'd not be mistaken in saying there was a peculiar <em>Nature</em> belonging to this <em>Form,</em> and common to it with others of the same kind.'

The <em>invisible etherial Substance,</em> penetrating both liquid and solid Bodys, is diffus'd thro'out the Universe. It cherishes the cold dull massy <em>Globe,</em> and warms it to its Center. It forms the Minerals; gives Life and Growth to Vegetables; kindles a soft, invisible, and vital <em>Flame</em> in the Breasts of living Creatures; frames, animates, and nurses all the various Forms; sparing, as well as imploying for their Use, those <em>sulphurous</em> and <em>combustible</em> Matters of which they are compos'd. Benign and gentle amidst all, it still maintains this happy Peace and Concord, according to its stated and peculiar Laws. But these once broken, the acquitted <em>Being</em> takes its Course unrul'd. It runs impetuous thro' the fatal Breach, and breaking into visible and fierce <em>Flames,</em> passes triumphant o'er the yielding Forms, converting all into it-self, and dissolving now those Systems which it-self before had form'd.
