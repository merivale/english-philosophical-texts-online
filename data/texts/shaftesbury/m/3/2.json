For whate'er is void of Mind, is <em>Void</em> and <em>Darkness</em> to the <em>Mind's</em> <b>Eye.</b> This languishes and grows dim, whene'er detain'd on foreign Subjects; but thrives and attains its natural Vigour, when employ'd in Contemplation of what is like it-self. 'Tis thus the <em>improving</em> <b>Mind,</b> slightly surveying other Objects, and passing over Bodys, and the common Forms, (where only a Shadow of Beauty rests) ambitiously presses onward to its <em>Source,</em> and views <em>the Original</em> of Form and Order in that which is intelligent. And thus, <b>OPhilocles!</b> may we improve and become Artists in the kind; learning <q>To know <em>Our-selves,</em> and what <em>That</em> is, which by improving, we may be sure to advance our Worth, and real Self-Interest.</q> For neither is this <em>Knowledg</em> acquir'd by Contemplation of Bodys, or the outward Forms, <label>Knowledg of our-selves.</label> the View of Pageantrys, the Study of Estates and Honours: nor is He to be esteem'd that self-improving Artist, who makes a Fortune out of these; but he, <em>He</em> only, is the <em>wise</em> and <em>able</em> Man, who with a slight regard to these Things, applies himself to cultivate another Soil, builds in a different Matter from that of Stone or Marble; and having righter Models in his Eye, <label>Interest.</label> becomes in truth the <em>Architect</em> of <em>his own Life</em> and <em>Fortune;</em> by laying within himself the lasting and sure Foundations of <em>Order, Peace,</em> <label>Ability.</label> and <em>Concord.</em>—But now 'tis time to think of returning home. The Morning is far spent. Come! Let us away, and leave these uncommon Subjects; till we retire again to these remote and unfrequented Places.</p>"

For as much convinc'd as I was, and as great a Convert to his Doctrine, my Danger still, I own'd to him, was very great: and I foresaw that when the Charm of these Places, and his Company was ceas'd, I shou'd be apt to relapse, and weakly yield to that too powerful Charm, <em>the World.</em> Tell me, continu'd I, how is it possible to hold out against it, and withstand the general Opinion of Mankind, who have so different a Notion of that which we call <em>Good?</em> Say truth now, <b>Theocles,</b> can any thing be more odd, or dissonant from the common Voice of the World, than what we have determin'd in this matter?</p>"
