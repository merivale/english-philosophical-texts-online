For at a time when this Mystery of <em>Gallantry</em> carry'd along with it the Notion of doughty Knighthood; when <em>the Fair</em> were made Witnesses, and in a manner, Partys to Feats of Arms, enter'd into all the Points of War and Combat, and were won by dint of Launce and manly Prowess; 'twas not altogether absurd, you thought, on such a foundation as this, to pay 'em Homage and Adoration, make 'em the Standard of Wit and Manners, and bring Mankind under their Laws. But in a Country where no <em>She-Saints</em> were worship'd by any Authority from Religion, 'twas as impertinent and sensless, as it was profane, to deify the Sex, raise 'em to a Capacity above what Nature had allow'd, and treat 'em with <em>a Respect,</em> which in the natural way of Love they themselves were the aptest to complain of.</p>"
