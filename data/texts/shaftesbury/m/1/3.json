Your Over-seriousness a-while since, at such an unseasonable time, may have driven me perhaps into a contrary Extreme, by opposition to your melancholy Humour. But I have now a better Idea of that <em>Melan</em><em>choly</em> you discover'd; and notwithstanding the humorous Turn you were pleas'd to give it, I am persuaded it has a different Foundation from any of those fantastical Causes I then assign'd to it. <q><b>Love,</b> <label>LOVE.</label> doubtless, is at the bottom; but a nobler Love than such as common Beautys inspire.</q>â€”</p>"

For 'tis not then that Men complain of the World's Order, or abhor the Face of things, when they see various Interests mix'd and interfering; Natures subordinate, of different kinds, oppos'd one to another, and in their different Operations submitted, the higher to the lower. 'Tis on the contrary, from this Order of inferior and superior Things, that we admire the<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> World's Beauty, founded thus <em>on Contrarietys:</em> whilst from such various and disagreeing Principles, <em>a universal Concord</em> is establish'd.</q></p>"

The numerous Insects are reduc'd by the superior Kinds of Birds and Beasts: and these again are check'd by Man; who in his turn submits to other Natures, and resigns his Form a Sacrifice in common to the rest of Things.

But here I'll answer for it; there was nothing of Disguise or Paint. All was fair, open, and genuine, as Nature herself. 'Twas <em>Nature</em> he was in love with: 'Twas <em>Nature</em> he sung. And if any-one might be said to have <em>a natural</em> Mistress, my Friend certainly might, whose Heart was thus ingag'd. But <b>Love,</b> I found, was every-where the same. And tho the Object here was very fine, and the Passion it created very noble; yet <em>Liberty,</em> I thought, was finer than all: And I who never car'd to ingage in other Loves of the least continuance, was the more afraid, I told you, of this which had such a power with my poor <em>Friend,</em> as to make him appear the perfectest <b>Enthusiast</b> in the World, <em>Ill-humour</em> only excepted. For this was singular in him, <q>That tho he had all of the <em>Enthusiast,</em> he had nothing of the <em>Bigot.</em> He heard every thing with Mildness and Delight; and bore with me when I treated all his Thoughts as visionary; and when, Sceptick-like, I unravel'd all his Systems.</q></p>"
