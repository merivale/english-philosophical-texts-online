Does it take from the Vigour of the Mind, consume the Body, and render both the one and the other less apt to their proper Exercises, <q>the Enjoyments of Reason or Sense, or the Employments and Offices of civil Life?</q> Or is it that a Man's Circumstances are the worse for it, as he stands towards his Friends, or Mankind? Is a Gentleman in this sense to be pity'd, <q>As <em>One</em> burdensom to himself, and others; <em>One</em> whom all Men will naturally shun, as an ill Friend, and a Corrupter of Society and Good Manners?</q>—Shall we consider our Gentleman in <em>a publick Trust,</em> and see whether he is like to succeed best with this restraining Quality; or whether he may be more rely'd on, and thought more incorrupt, if his Appetites are high, and his Relish strong towards that which we call Pleasure? Shall we consider him as <em>a Soldier,</em> in a Campain, or Siege; and advise with our-selves how we might be best defended, if we had occasion for such a one's Service? <q>Which Officer wou'd make the best for the Soldiers; Which Soldier for the Officers; or Which Army for their Country?</q>—What think you of our Gentleman, for <em>a Fellow-traveller?</em> Wou'd he, as a temperate Man, be an ill Choice?

Perhaps the <em>amorous Galants,</em> and exquisite <em>Refiners</em> on this sort of Pleasure, may have so refin'd their Minds and Tempers, that, notwithstanding their accustom'd Indulgence, they can, upon occasion, renounce their Enjoyment, rather than violate Honour, Faith, or Justice.—And thus, at last, there will be little Virtue or Worth ascrib'd to this patient sober <em>Character.</em> <q>The dull <em>temperate Man</em> is no fitter to be trusted than the elegant <em>luxurious</em> one. Innocence, Youth, and Fortune may be as well committed to the Care of this latter Gentleman. He wou'd prove as good <em>an Executor,</em> as good <em>a Trustee,</em> as good <em>a Guardian,</em> as he wou'd <em>a Friend.</em> The Family which entrusted him wou'd be secure; and no Dishonour, in any likelihood, wou'd happen from the honest <em>Man of Pleasure.</em></q></p>"
