We have cast up all those Particulars, from whence (as by way of Addition and Subtraction) the main <em>Sum</em> or general Account of Happiness, is either augmented or diminish'd. And if there be no Article exceptionable in this Scheme of <em>Moral Arithmetick;</em> the Subject treated may be said to have an Evidence as great as that which is found in Numbers, or Mathematicks. For let us carry <em>Scepticism</em> ever so far, let us doubt, if we can, of every thing about us; we cannot doubt of what passes <em>within our-selves.</em> Our Passions and Affections are known to us. <em>They</em> are certain, whatever the <em>Objects</em> may be, on which they are employ'd. Nor is it of any concern to our Argument, how these exterior Objects stand; whether they are Realitys, or mere Illusions; whether we wake or dream. For <em>ill Dreams</em> will be equally disturbing. And a good <em>Dream,</em> if Life be nothing else, will be easily and happily pass'd. In this Dream of Life, therefore, our Demonstrations have the same force; our <em>Balance</em> and <em>OEconomy</em> hold good, and our Obligation to <b>Virtue</b> is in every respect the same.</p>"
