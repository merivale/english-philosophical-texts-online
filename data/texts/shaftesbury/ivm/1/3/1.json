      "content": "<p>IT will not surely be understood, that by this is meant <em>the taking away the Notion of what is</em> good <em>or</em> ill <em>in the Species, or Society.</em> For of the Reality of such a <em>Good</em> and <em>Ill,</em> no rational Creature can possibly be insensible. Every one discerns and owns a publick Interest, and is conscious of what affects his Fellowship or Community. When we say therefore of a Creature, <q>That he has wholly lost the Sense of Right and Wrong</q>; we suppose that being able to discern the <em>Good</em> and <em>Ill</em> of his Species, he has at the same time no Concern for either, nor any Sense of Excellency or Baseness in any moral Action, relating to one or the other. So that except merely with respect to a private and narrowly confin'd Self-good, 'tis suppos'd there is in such a Creature no <em>Liking</em> or <em>Dislike</em> of Manners; no Admiration, or Love of any thing as morally good; nor Hatred of any thing as morally ill, be it ever so unnatural or deform'd.</p>"

'Tis full as impossible to conceive, that a rational Creature coming first to be try'd by rational Objects, and receiving into his Mind the Images or Representations of Justice, Generosity, Gratitude, or other Virtue, shou'd have no <em>Liking</em> of these, or <em>Dislike</em> of their contrarys; but be found absolutely indifferent towards whatsoever is presented to him of this sort. A Soul, indeed, may as well be without <em>Sense,</em> as without Admiration in the Things of which it has any knowledg. Coming therefore to a Capacity of seeing and admiring in this new way, it must needs find a Beauty and a Deformity as well in Actions, Minds, and Tempers, as in Figures, Sounds, or Colours. If there be no <em>real</em> Amiableness or Deformity in moral Acts, there is at least <em>an imaginary one</em> of full force. Tho perhaps the Thing itself shou'd not be allow'd in Nature, the Imagination or Fancy of it must be allow'd to be from Nature alone. Nor can any thing besides Art and strong Endeavour, with long Practice and Meditation, overcome such a <em>natural Prevention,</em> or <a href=\"#n1\">[1]</a><em>Prepossession</em> of the Mind, in favour of this moral Distinction.</p>"
