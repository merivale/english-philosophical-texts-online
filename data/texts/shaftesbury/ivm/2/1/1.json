To stand thus well affected, and to have one's Affections <em>right</em> and <em>intire,</em> not only in respect of one's self, but of Society and the Publick: This is <em>Rectitude, Integrity,</em> or <b>Virtue</b>.

Nor will any-one deny that this Affection of a Creature towards the Good of the Species or common Nature, is as <em>proper</em> and <em>natural</em> to him, as it is to any Organ, Part or Member of an Animal-Body, or mere Vegetable, to work in its known Course, and regular way of Growth. 'Tis not more <em>natural</em> for the Stomach to digest, the Lungs to breathe, the Glands to separate Juices, or other Intrails to perform their several Offices; however they may by particular Impediments be sometimes disorder'd, or obstructed in their Operations.</p>"

So that according to a known<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> way of reasoning on <em>Self-interest,</em> that which is of a social kind in us, shou'd of right be abolish'd. Thus Kindness of every sort, Indulgence, Tenderness, Compassion, and in short, all natural Affection shou'd be industriously suppress'd, and, as mere Folly, and Weakness of Nature, be resisted and overcome; that, by this means, there might be nothing remaining in us, which was contrary to a direct <em>Self-end;</em> nothing which might stand in opposition to a steddy and deliberate Pursuit of the most narrowly confin'd <em>Self-interest.</em></p>"
