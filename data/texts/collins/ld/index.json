  "comments": "In 1706, Clarke published a <i>Letter to Mr Dodwell</i>, in response to his <a href=\"/browse/dodwell/ed\">Epistolary Discourse</a>. Shortly after, Collins published a <i>Letter to the Learned Mr. Henry Dodwell</i>, as a direct response to Clarke's criticisms. A series of public letters between Clarke and Collins followed over the next few years, furthering the debate. They were never published as a set, but it was thought convenient to reproduce them here in that fashion.",
