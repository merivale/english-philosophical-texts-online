  "comments": "<i>De Cive</i> was first published in Latin in 1642, and then published in English in 1651, as <i>Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and Society</i>. Our copytext is this first English edition. Though the first to be published, it was destined to become the last of a three-part set. Part one, <i>De Corpore</i>, was published in 1655, followed by part two, <i>De Homine</i>, in 1658. Both of these were in Latin; Hobbes never published <i>De Homine</i> in English, but an English version of <i>De Corpore</i> appeared in 1656, as <a href\"/browse/hobbes/cor\"><i>The Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body</i></a>.",
