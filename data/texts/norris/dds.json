  "comments": "In 1690, Norris published his <i>Christian Blessedness, or, Discourses upon the Beatitudes of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</i>, following this up in 1691 with a set of <i>Practical Discourses upon Several Divine Subjects</i>. In 1693 the latter was reprinted as &ldquo;Volume II&rdquo;, as was another set titled &lsquo;Volume III&rdquo;. Thus the original <i>Discourses on the Beatitudes</i> retrospectively became Volume I of these <i>Practical Discourses</i>. A fourth volume was printed in 1698.",
