      "content": "<p>THo' Authorities go but a very little way with me in Questions whose Determination depends upon Measures of Reason, yet finding that the great and general Objection that lies against the present Conclusion is the pretended Singularity of it, I think it convenient to set down a very signal Passage which (since the writing the Preface) I have met with in the late Continuation <em>des Essais de morale</em> Part 2. Tom. 1. Pag. 59, where upon that Text of St. <em>Peter</em>, <em>I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly Lusts</em>, &amp;c. the excellent Moralist has these Words, <em>But what is the Extent of these carnal Desires which St. <em>Peter</em> forbids us? It is easie to mark it out. For all that which is not God is carnal according to the Scripture because it is a Consequence of the Corruption of the Heart, which having separated us from the Love of God has made the Soul willing to fill that Emptiness which she feels in her self by the Possession of Creatures. Whether these Objects are spiritual or Corporal, the Desires which we have of them are always carnal in the Language of Scripture. For which reasen it is that St. <em>Paul</em> puts Dissentions and Emulations among the Works of the Flesh. So that it is a no less carnal Lust to desire Glory and Reputation, and all that serves in order to it, than to desire the Pleasures of the Body, because these Objects are no more our true good than the other. God does no more permit that we should part our Love between him and Reputation, between him and the Affection of Men, than between him and feasting and other Bodily Pleasures. For 'tis always the Division of a thing which was all due to him. 'Tis always a Debasement of the Soul, which being made for GOD stoops beneath and degrades her self in being willing to enjoy a Creature either equal or inferiour to her self. GOD is great enough to be the only and intire Object of our Heart, and 'tis to injure him to divide it, because 'tis in effect to declare to him that he does not deserve it all.</em></p>"

'Twere infinite to appeal to all those Writers who have either directly asserted this Conclusion, or occasionally let fall Expressions that favour and insinuate it. There is hardly a Book of Morality or Devotion extant whererein Passages of this Nature are not to be found. I do not say there are many that offer to deduce this Conclusion from Principles, but that it is generally held, and upon all Occasions alluded to and glanced at, which is enough to shew the irresistible Prevalency of the Truth, and to skreen them from the prejudice and imputation of Novelty and Singularity, who undertake upon a rational Ground to clear and defend it.</p>"
