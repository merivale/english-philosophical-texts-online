Her Name I have not the Liberty to publish. For her Person, as her Modesty will not suffer me to say much of her, so the present Productions of her Pen make it utterly needless to say any thing, unless it be by way of Prevention to obviate a Diffidence in some who from the surprizing Excellency of these Writings may be tempted to question whether my Correspondent be really a Woman or no. To whom my Answer is, that indeed I did not see her write these Letters, but that I have all the moral and reasonable Assurance that she did write them, and is the true Author of them, that can be had in a thing of this Nature. And I hope my Credit may be good enough with those that know me to be believed upon my serious Word, where there is no other Satisfaction to be given.</em></p>"

And 'twere much to be wished that this were made more the Subject not only of our Conversations and Letters (instead of those many empty and impertinent Formalities that usually fill and ingross them) but even of our Books and more elaborate Composures, which I think would be better imployed in laying good Foundations for the Love of GOD, and raising the low-sunk Practice of it, than in curious Researches of his Nature, and an eternal Contention and tedious <em>Chicane</em> about the <em>Trinity</em>. Men may wrangle for ever about these abstruse Theories, and sooner dispute themselves out of Charity than into Truth, but our Wills have at present a larger Capacity than our Understandings, and our Love of GOD may be very flaming and seraphick, when after the greatest Elevation and Soar of Thought_ our Conceptions of him are but faint and shadowy, and we see him but in a Glass darkly. But if we would even make this Glass more transparent, 'tis Love that must clarifie and refine it. An affectionate Sense of GOD will discover more of him to us, than all the dry Study and Speculation of Scholastick Heads, the Fire of our Hearts will give the best and truest Light to our Eyes, and when all is done the <em>Love</em> of GOD is the best <em>Contemplation</em>.</em></p>"

But whatever other Qualifications are requisite, a Heart once truly touched with this divine Passion cannot long want them. Love will draw along after it all other Virtues, will perfect and improve them, and will at least hide those Faults of them which it cannot correct. For this is that universal Excellency which supplies the Defects of other Works, but which if wanting (such a necessary and vital Part it is) nothing else can supply or compound for. Neither Tongues, nor Prophecy, nor Knowledge, nor Faith, nor Alms, nor even Martyrdom it self signifie any thing without Charity. The Heart is the Sacrifice that GOD demands, and unless that be offered, the richest Oblation will find no Acceptance. Other Gifts and Graces, whether intellectual or moral, come indeed from Heaven, but they often leave us upon Earth. Love only elevates us up thither, and is able to unite us to God. 'Tis this indeed that gives us the strictest Union with him in this Life. By Faith we live upon GOD, by Obedience we live to him, but 'tis by Love alone that we live in him. And so <u>St. <em>John</em></u>, <em>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love dwelleth in God and God in him</em>. A Passage that makes highly for the Privilege of Love, and which I cannot mention without calling to mind a most Divine Remark which the <em><u>Port Royal</u></em><a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, in their late Abstract of the Morality of the New Testament has upon it. <em>O great GOD, you are all Love in your self, and all Love for Man, and Man dares deliberate whether he should love you, and to inquire when and how far he is obliged to do it. If to love GOD be to possess him, and to be possessed by him, what an Emptiness is there in that Heart which does not love God, or of what is it full if not of Vanity and Indigence it self?</em></em></p>"

There are <em>Mysteries</em> in the Love of God as well as in other Parts of Religion which to the Minds of Men arm'd as they are with sensible Prejudices, will appear very difficult, and which the most purged and illuminated Spirits will not presently comprehend, and which even those that do will not easily explain so as to make them intelligible to others. Practice and Experiment will go furthest here, but after all we must be often forced to cry, <em>O the Depth!</em> <u>St. <em>Paul</em></u> seems to have been sensible of this when he prayed for his <em>Ephesians</em>, that <em>being rooted and grounded in Love, they might be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth and Length and Depth and Heighth, and to know the Love of <u>Christ</u> which passes Knowledge</em>.

But let me only desire them to consider (besides what they will find for the Justification of our Measure in the following Papers) that the Love here discoursed of and recommended is the Love of a <em>God</em>, that is, of all that is good, of all that is perfect, of all that is lovely, of all that is desirable, in short, of all that truly is, and can any Love be too great or too high for such an Object? Or rather does he not deserve infinitely more than we or any of his Creatures can bestow upon him? What can an infinite good be loved too much, or is any Degree of Love too high for him who is infinitely lovely, and who infinitely loves himself? Is the Heart of Man too great a Sacrifice for a God, though it were intirely offered and wholly burnt and consumed at his Altar? Especially since he himself demands it all, requiring us to love him with our whole Heart, Soul, and Mind. And would we present him with less? What do we think the whole too great for him that we thus mince and divide it! But does not our Conscience secretly reproach us when we do so? Yes, it continually upbraids to us the Love of Creatures, and is always like a faithful Advocate pleading in the Behalf of God, and asserting his sovereign Right. And why then should it be thought such a Stretch of the Love of God to make it intire and exclusive of all other Loves? Can we love God too much, or Creatures too little? Or is it such a Paradox to make the Church speak to <u>Christ</u> in the same Language wherein he condescends to speak to her, <em>my Love, my undefiled is but one</em>.</em></p>"

It is <u><em>Bishop Lake</em></u>, who in his seventh Sermon upon those Words, <em>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart</em>, &amp;c. <cite>Matth. 22. and 37.</cite> (the very Text we build upon) expresses himself thus: <em>In the Question of Perfection Divines require a double Perfection, one <i>partium</i>, the other <i>graduum</i>. There is a Perfection of the Parts in Man, which must be seasoned with the Vertue, and the Vertue in those Parts must arise unto its full Pitch. This Text requires both these Perfections in Charity. The Perfection on of the Parts of Man are intimated in the Enumeration of the Heart, Mind, Soul and Strength, unto which all our inward and outward Abilities may be reduced. So that there is no Power or Part of Man that must not be qualified with the Love of God. But of this Perfection I have spoken when I shewed you the Seat of Love. I made it plain unto you that there was to be in our Charity a Perfection of Parts. That with which we have now to do is the Perfection of Degrees. The Text will tell us that it is not enough for every of those Parts to have the Love of God in them, they must also be wholly taken up therewith. And this Perfection is noted by the Word (all) which is added to Heart, Soul, Mind, and Strength.</em></em></p>"

If the Image and Superscription were a just ground why Coin should be paid unto <u><em>Caesar</em></u>, where GOD's Image is found there is as good a Reason that that should be rendred unto him. Now God's Image is found in us by Nature, for we were made according to his Image, so that all which we receive from him we owe unto him by the Law of Creation. A second way is God's Image in us, by Grace. For our Regeneration is but a second Creation, wherein we are reformed unto that Image according to which God at first created us.
