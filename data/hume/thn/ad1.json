The reader must only observe, that all the subjects I have there plann'd out to myself, are not treated of in these two volumes. The subjects of the <em>understanding</em> and <em>passions</em> make a compleat chain of reasoning by themselves; and I was willing to take advantage of this natural division, in order to try the taste of the public. If I have the good fortune to meet with success, I shall proceed to the examination of <em>morals</em>, <em>politics</em>, and <em>criticism</em>; which will compleat this <em>Treatise of human nature</em>. The approbation of the public I consider as the greatest reward of my labours; but am determin'd to regard its judgment, whatever it be, as my best instruction.</em></p>"
