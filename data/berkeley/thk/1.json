By Sight I have the Ideas of Light and Colours with their several Degrees and Variations. By Touch I perceive Hard and Soft, Heat and Cold, Motion and Resistance, <em>&amp;c.</em> and of all these more and less either as to Quantity or Degree. Smelling furnishes me with Odors; the Palate with Tastes, and Hearing conveys Sounds to the Mind in all their variety of Tone and Composition. And as several of these are observ'd to accompany each other, they come to be marked by one Name, and so to be reputed as one Thing. Thus, for Example, a certain Colour, Taste, Smell, Figure and Consistence having been observ'd to go together, are accounted one distinct Thing, signified by the name <em>Apple</em>. Other Collections of Ideas constitute a Stone, a Tree, a Book and the like sensible Things; which as they are pleasing or disagreeable excite the Passions of Love, Hatred, Joy, Grief, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>"

And to me it is no less evident that the various Sensations or Ideas imprinted on the Sense, however Blended or Combin'd together (that is whatever Objects they compose) cannot Exist otherwise than in a Mind perceiving them. I think an intuitive Knowlege may be obtain'd of this, by any one that shall attend to what is meant by the Term <em>Exist</em> when apply'd to sensible Things. The Table I Write on, I say, Exists, <em>i. e.</em> I See and Feel it, and if I were out of my Study I shou'd say it Existed, meaning thereby that if I was in my Study I might perceive it, or that some other Spirit actually does perceive it. There was an Odor, <em>i. e.</em> it was Smelt; There was a Sound, <em>i. e.</em> it was Heard; a Colour or Figure and it was perceiv'd by Sight or Touch. This is all that I can understand by these and the like Expressions. For as to what is said of the Absolute Existence of unthinking Things without any relation to their being perceiv'd, that is to me perfectly Unintelligible. Their <em>Esse</em> is <em>Percipi</em>, nor is it possible they shou'd have any Existence, out of the Minds or thinking Things which perceive them.</p>"

For what are the foremention'd Objects but the things we perceive by Sense, and what, I pray you, do we perceive besides our own Ideas or Sensations, and is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these or any Combination of them shou'd Exist unperceiv'd?</p>"

For can there be a nicer Strain of Abstraction then to distinguish the Existence of sensible Objects from their being Perceiv'd, so as to conceive them Existing Unperceiv'd? Light and Colours, Heat and Cold, Extension and Figures, in a word the Things we See and Feel what are they but so many Sensations, Notions, Ideas or Impressions on the Sense, and is it possible to separate, even in thought, any of these from Perception? For my part I might as easily divide a Thing from it Self. I may, indeed, divide in my Thoughts or conceive apart from each other those Things which, perhaps, I never perceiv'd by Sense so divided. Thus I imagine the Trunk of a Human Body without the Limbs, or conceive the Smell of a Rose without thinking on the Rose it self. So far I will not deny I can Abstract, if that may properly be called <em>Abstraction</em>, which extends only to the conceiving separately such Objects, as it is possible may really exist or be actually perceived asunder. But my conceiving or imagining Power does not extend beyond the possibility of real Existence or Perception. Hence as it is impossible, for me to See or Feel any Thing without an actual Sensation of that Thing, so is it impossible for me to conceive in my Thoughts any sensible Thing or Object distinct from the Sensation or Perception of it. In truth the Object and the Sensation are the same thing, and cannot therefore be Abstracted from each other.</p>"

To make this appear with all the Light and Evidence of an Axiom, it seems sufficient if I can but awaken the Reflexion of the Reader, that he may take an impartial View of his own Meaning, and turn his Thoughts upon the Subject it self, free and disengaged from all Embarras of Words and Prepossession in favour of received Mistakes.</p>"

Now for an Idea to Exist in an unperceiving Thing is a manifest Contradiction, for to have an Idea is all one as to perceive, that therefore wherein Colour, Figure, <em>&amp;c.</em> Exist must perceive them; Hence 'tis clear there can be no unthinking Substance or <em>Substratum</em> of those Ideas.</p>"

If we look but never so little into our Thoughts, we shall find it impossible for us to conceive a Likeness except only between our Ideas. Again, I ask whether those suppos'd Originals or External Things, of which our Ideas are the Pictures or Representations, be themselves Perceivable or no? If they are, then they are Ideas and we have gain'd our Point; but if you say they are not, I appeal to any one whether it be Sense, to assert a Colour is like something which is invisible; Hard or Soft, like something which is Intangible, and so of the rest.</p>"

By Matter, therefore, we are to understand an Inert, Senseless Substance, in which Extension, Figure, Motion, <em>&amp;c.</em> do actually subsist, But it is evident from what we have already shewn, that Extension, Figure and Notion are only Ideas existing in the Mind, and that an Idea can be like nothing but another Idea. and that consequently neither They nor their Archetypes can Exist in an unperceiving Substance. Hence it is plain, that the very Notion of what is called <em>Matter</em> or <em>Corporeal Substance</em>, involves a Contradiction in it. Insomuch that I shou'd not think it necessary to spend more time in exposing it's Absurdity. But because the Tenent of the Existence of Matter seems to have taken so deep a Root in the Minds of Philosophers, and draws after it so many ill Consequences, l chuse rather to be thought Prolix and Tedious, than omit any thing that might conduce to the full Discovery and Extirpation of that Prejudice.</p>"

This they take for an undoubted Truth, which they can demonstrate beyond all Exception. Now if it be certain, that those Original Qualities are inseparably united with the other sensible Qualities, and not, even in Thought, capable of being Abstracted from them, it plainly follows that they Exist only in the Mind. But I desire any one to reflect and try, whether he can by any Abstraction of Thought, conceive the Extension and Motion of a Body, without all other sensible Qualities. For my own part, I see evidently that it is not in my power to frame an Idea of a Body Extended and Moving, but I must withal give it some Colour or other sensible Quality which is acknowleg'd to Exist only in the Mind. In short, Extension, Figure, and Motion, abstracted from all other Qualities, are inconceivable.

The Extension therefore which Exists without the Mind, is neither Great nor Small, the Motion, neither Swift nor Slow, that is, they are nothing at all. But say you they are Extension in General, and Motion in General: Thus we see how much the Tenent of extended, moveable Substances Existing without the Mind depends on that strange Doctrine of <em>Abstract Ideas</em>. And here I can't but remark, how nearly the Vague and indeterminate Description of Matter or Corporeal Substance which the Modern Philosophers are run into by their own Principles, resembles that antiquated and so much ridicul'd Notion of <em>Materia Prima</em>, to be met with in <em>Aristotle</em> and his Followers.

Number is so visibly relative, and dependent on Mens Understanding, that it is strange to think how any one shou'd give it an absolute Existence without the Mind.

Thus, for Instance, it is said that Heat and Cold, are Affections only of the Mind, and not at all Patterns of real Beings, existing in the Corporeal Substances which excite them, for that the same Body which appears Cold to one Hand, seems Warm to another. Now why may we not as well argue that Figure and Extension, are not Patterns or Resemblances of Qualities existing in Matter, because to the same Eye at different Stations, or Eyes of a different Texture at the same Station, they appear various, and cannot therefore be the Images of any thing settled and determinate without the Mind? again, 'Tis prov'd that Sweetness is not really in the Sapid Thing, because the thing remaining unalter'd the Sweetness is changed into Bitter, as in case of a Fever or otherwise vitiated Palate.

Thô it must be confess'd this method of Arguing does not so much prove that there is no Extension, Colour, <em>&amp;c.</em> in an outward Object, as that we do not know by Sense which is the true Extension or Colour of the Object.

So that when I consider the two Parts or Branches which make the signification of the Words <em>Material Substance</em>, I am convinced there is no distinct meaning annext to them. But why shou'd we trouble our selves any farther, in discussing this Material <em>Substratum</em> or Support of Figure and Motion, <em>&amp;c.</em> does it not suppose they have an Existence without the Mind?

Either we must know it by Sense or by Reason. As for our Senses, by them we have the Knowlege only of our Sensations, Ideas, or those things that are immediately perceiv'd by Sense, call 'em what you will: But they do not inform us that things Exist without the Mind, or unperceiv'd, like to those which are perceiv'd. This the Materialists themselves acknowlege. It remains therefore that if we have any Knowlege at all of External Things, it must be by Reason, inferring their Existence from what is immediately perceiv'd by Sense. But I do not see what reason can induce us to believe the Existence of Bodies without the Mind, from what we perceive, since the very Patrons of Matter themselves do not pretend, there is any necessary Connexion betwixt them and our Ideas. I say it is granted on all Hands (and what happens in Dreams, Frenzys and the like puts it beyond dispute) that it is possible we might be affected with all the Ideas we have now, thô there were no Bodies Existing without resembling them. Hence it is evident the Supposition of External Bodies is not necessary for the producing our Ideas: Since it is granted they are produced sometimes, and might possibly be produced always in the same Order, we see them in at present, without their Concurrence.</p>"

But neither can this be said, for thô we give the Materialists their External Bodies, they by their one confession are never the nearer knowing how our Ideas are produced: Since they own themselves unable to comprehend in what manner Body can act upon Spirit, or how it is possible it shou'd imprint any Idea in the Mind. Hence it is evident the Production of Ideas or Sensations in our Minds, can be no reason why we shou'd suppose Matter or Corporeal Substances, since that is acknowleg'd to remain equally inexplicable with, or without this Supposition. If therefore it were possible for Bodies to Exist without the Mind, yet to hold they do so, must needs be a very precarious Opinion; since it is to suppose, without any reason at all, that God has Created innumerable Beings that are intirely useless, and serve to no manner of purpose.</p>"

For it is evident from <em>Sect.</em> XI, <em>&amp;c.</em> that the Matter Philosophers contend for is an incomprehensible Somewhat which hath none of those particular Qualities, whereby the Bodies falling under our Senses are distinguished one from another. But to make this more plain, it must be remarked that the Infinite Divisibility of Matter is now universally allow'd, at least by the most approv'd and considerable Philosophers, who on the receiv'd Principles demonstrate it beyond all exception. Hence it follows, there is an infinite number of Parts in each Particle of Matter, which are not perceiv'd by Sense. The reason, therefore, that any particular Body seems to be of a finite Magnitude, or exhibits only a finite number of Parts to Sense, is, not because it contains no more, since in it self it contains an infinite number of Parts, but because the Sense is not acute enough to discern them. In proportion therefore as the Sense is render'd more acute, it perceives a greater num-of Parts in the Object <em>i.e.</em> the Object appears greater, and its Figure varies, those Parts in its Extremities which were before unperceivable, appearing now to bound it in very different Lines and Angles from those perceived by an obtuser Sense. And at length, after various changes of Size and Shape, when the Sense becomes infinitely acute, the Body shall seem infinite. During all which there is no alteration in the Body, but only in the Sense. Each Body, therefore, consider'd in it self is infinitely extended, and consequently void of all Shape or Figure. From which it follows that thô we shou'd grant the Existence of Matter to be never so certain, yet it is withal as certain, the Materialists themselves are by their own Principles forced to acknowlege, that neither the particular Bodies perceived by Sense, nor any thing like them Exists without the Mind. Matter, I say, and each Particle thereof is according to them Infinite and Shapeless, and it is the Mind that frames all that variety of Bodies which compose the visible World, any one whereof does not Exist longer than it is perceiv'd.</p>"

And this Notion of the Philosophers ows its Origine to the same cause with the former, namely their being conscious that they were not the Authors of their own Sensations, which they evidently knew were imprinted from without, and which therefore must have some cause, distinct from the Minds on which they are imprinted.</p>"

For the rest, this Celebrated Author holds there is an <em>Absolute Space</em>, which, being unperceivable to Sense, remains in it self similar and immoveable: And Relative Space to be the measure thereof, which being moveable, and defin'd by its Situation in respect of Sensible Bodies, is vulgarly taken for Immoveable Space. <em>Place</em> he Defines, to be that Part of Space which is occupied by any Body. And according as the Space is Absolute or Relative, so also is the Place. <em>Absolute Motion</em> is said to be the Translation of a Body, from Absolute Place to Absolute Place, as Relative Motion is, from one Relative Place to another. Now because the Parts of Absolute Space, do not fall under our Senses, instead of them we are obliged to use their Sensible Measures: And so define both Place and Motion with respect to Bodies, which we regard as immoveable. But it is said, in Philosophical Matters we must Abstract from our Senses, since it may be, that none of those Bodies, which seem to be quiescent, are truely so: And the same thing which is mov'd Relatively, may be really at rest. As likewise one and the same Body may be in Relative Rest and Motion, or even mov'd with contrary Relative Motions, At the same time, according as its place is variously defin'd. All which Ambiguity is to be found in the apparent Motions, but not at all in the true or absolute, which shou'd therefore he alone regarded in Philosophy. And the True, we are told, are distinguish'd from Apparent or Relative Motions, by the following Properties. First, In True or Absolute Motion, all Parts which preserve the same Position with respect to the Whole, partake of the Motions of the Whole. Secondly, The Place being moved, that which is placed therein is also mov'd: So that a Body moving in a place which is in Motion, doth participate the Motion of its Place. Thirdly, True Motion is never generated or changed, otherwise then by Force impressed on the Body it self. Fourthly, True Motion is always changed, by Force impressed on the Body moved. Fifthly, In Circular Motion barely Relative, there is no Centrifugal Force, which nevertheless in that which is True or Absolute, is proportional to the Quantity of Motion.</p>"

In the common Affairs of Life, Men never go beyond the Earth, to define the place of any Body: And what is quiescent in respect of that, is accounted <em>absolutely</em> to be so. But Philosophers, who have a greater Extent of Thought, and juster Notions of the System of Things, discover even the Earth it self to be moved. In order therefore to fix their Notions, they seem to conceive the Corporeal World as Finite, and the utmost, unmoved Walls or Shell thereof to be the Place, whereby they estimate True Motions. If we sound our own Conceptions, I believe we may find all the Absolute Motion we can frame an Idea of, to be at Bottom no other than Relative Motion thus defined.

I grant, indeed, that it is possible for us to think a Body, which we see change its Distance from some other, to be moved, tho' it have no force impressed on it, (in which Sense there may be apparent Motion,) but then it is, because the Force causing the change of Distance, is imagin'd by us to be impress'd on that Body thought to move. Which, indeed, shews we are capable of mistaking a thing to be in Motion which is not, but does not prove that, in the common acceptation of <em>Motion</em>, a Body is moved meerly because it changes Distance from another; since as soon as we are undeceiv'd, and find that the moving Force was not communicated to it, we no longer hold it to be moved. So on the other hand, when one only Body (the Parts whereof preserve a given Position between themselves) is imagin'd to Exist; some there are who think that it can be moved all manner of ways, tho' without any change of Distance or Situation to any other Bodies; which we shou'd not deny, if they meant only that it might have an impressed Force, which, upon the bare creation of other Bodies, wou'd produce a Motion of any certain Quantity and Determination.

Afterwards, they found out the more compendious ways, of making one Character stand in place of several Stroaks, or Points. And lastly, the Notation of the <em>Arabians</em> or <em>Indians</em> came into use, wherein by the repetition of a few Characters or Figures, and varying the Signification of each Figure according to the the place it obtains, all Numbers may be most aptly express'd: Which seems to have been done in Imitation of Language, so that an exact Analogy is observ'd betwixt the Notation by Figures, and Names, the nine simple Figures answering the nine first numeral Names, and Places in the former corresponding to Denominations in the latter.

For then the Number of any particular Things is said to be known, when we know the Name or Figures (with their due arangement) that according to the standing Analogy belong to them. For these Signs being known, we can by the Operations of Arithmetic, know the Signs of any Part of the particular Sums signified by them; and thus computing in Signs, (because of the connexion establish'd betwixt them and the distinct multitudes of Things, whereof one is taken for an Unite, we may be able rightly to sum Up, Divide, and Proportion the things Themselves that we intend to Number.</p>"

So that, according to them an Inch does not barely contain an infinite number of Parts, but an Infinity of an Infinity of an Infinity <em>ad infinitum</em> of Parts. Others there be who hold, all orders of Infinitesimals below the first to be nothing at all, thinking it, with good reason, Absurd, to imagine there is any positive Quantity or Part of Extension, which, tho' multiplyed Infinitely, can never equal the smallest given Extension. And yet on the other hand, it seems no less Absurd, to think the Square, Cube, or other Power of a positive, real Root, shou'd it self be nothing at all; which they, who hold Infinitesimals of the first Order, denying all of the subsequent Orders, are obliged to maintain.</p>"

For what else can it be but some lurking Infidelity, some secret misgivings of Mind, with regard to the Existence and Attributes of GOD, which permits Sinners to grow and harden in Impiety? Since it is downright impossible, that a Soul pierced and enlighten'd with a thorough Sense of the Omnipresence, Holiness, and Justice of that <em>Almighty Spirit</em>, shou'd persist in a remorsless Violation of his Laws. We ought, therefore, earnestly to meditate and dwell on those important Points; that so we may attain Conviction without all Scruple, <em>that the Eyes of the LORD are in every place beholding the Evil and the Good; that he is with us and keepeth us in all places whither we go, and giveth us Bread to eat and Raiment to put on</em>; that he is present and conscious to our innermost Thoughts; in fine, that we have a most absolute and immediate Dependence on Him. A clear View of which great Truths cannot chuse but fill our Hearts, with an awful Circumspection and holy Fear, which is the strongest Incentive to <em>Vertue</em>, and the best Guard against <em>Vice</em>.</p>"
