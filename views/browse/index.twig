  <h1>Browse Texts</h1>
  <p>There are currently {{ authors | length }} authors in the library ({{ males | length }} male and {{ females | length }} female). We have drawn up a list of desired works for each author, which you can view by clicking on the author's name below. So far we have imported {{ imported }} texts out of a total of {{ total }}, by {% for author in authorsWithTexts %}{% if loop.last %} and {% endif %}<a href="{{ author.url }}">{{ author.fullname }}</a>{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}.</p>
  <p>Please let us know if any text is particularly important to you, and we will do our best to incorporate it sooner rather than later. Please also let us know if we are missing any work that you would like to see included. If you are also able to point us in the direction of a good (and publicly available) digital edition, so much the better.</p>
